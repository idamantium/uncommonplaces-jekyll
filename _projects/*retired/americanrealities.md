The American Realities website is a media rich experience of documentary reporting on poverty in America. 

I designed the Wordpress site to immerse visitors in the personal stories that journalist Natasha del Toro and photographer Joakim Eskildsen gathered on their cross-country reporting for Time Magazine. Parallax scrolling, HTML5 media and a responsive layout make for a narratively rich experience that is compatible across devices. 


> Working with Ida on my American Realities website has been an absolute pleasure. From concept to design to execution, Ida walked me through the process of how to create and populate the site every step of the way with patience and professionalism. Her creativity and aesthetic vision took my project to the next level. I'm incredibly proud of the work we have done and am so grateful that Ida was on board to help me turn my idea for this website into reality."
