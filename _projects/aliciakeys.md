short-description: Charity pledge redesign with star power to bring in the money
---


AIDS charity Keep A Child Alive runs a dynamite charity gala with a star-studded attendees and performances from A-list musical talent. Their program was so loved that shaking things up seemed a bit risky, but they hired my experience design outfit Sextantworks to do just that.

After creating individualized moments of gratitude for their top 20 donors one year, we went on to revamp the pledge the next year. The standing pledge with donations levels inspired by the Fibonacci sequence brought in 45% more donations than their best pledge year ever and 76% more than the previous year. Swizz Beatz and Sean Puffy Colmes orchestrated our design and wrapped the pledge script I wrote.
