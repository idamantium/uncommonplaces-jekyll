The Yellow Thread Society is New York's first (almost) monthly get-together featuring women in games. I founded the series with <a href="http://varelidi.com/" target="_blank">Chloe Varelidi</a> of littleBits. We're knitting together a diverse, adventurous and inclusive game community were women don't need to shout to be heard. People of all genders welcome to attend. Our inaugural special guest was Arkadium co-founder Jessica Rovello. We've hosted get-togethers at IndieCade East and the Game Developers Conference.
