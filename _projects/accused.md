Accused is a browser-based game about false confessions and wrongful convictions. I created Accused at <a href="http://playistheantidote.com/" target="_blank">Antidote Games</a> for <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/" target="_blank">the Innocence Project</a>. The police call you in to help solve the crime of a brutal break-in at a neighbor’s apartment. Beware; everything isn’t as it seems. 

According to the Innocence Project, false confessions may be the single leading cause of wrongful convictions in homicide cases. The narrative system of Accused is closely maps to coercive interrogation techniques taught in police training academies. Antidote Games used popular interactive fiction engine <a href="http://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a> to implement the gameplay in a custom interface for wide distribution online.
