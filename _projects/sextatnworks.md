<a href="http://sextantworks.com" target="_blank">Sextantworks</a> (originally Wanderlust Projects) practiced transgressive placemaking and experiential gift design through generosity, location and intimacy. We made expereinces in places you aren't supposed to be. I started Sextantworks with N.D. Austin in 2012. We designed dozens of site-specific expereinces in New York City and abroad over the course of nearly four years.

Our exploits included a speakeasy in a dry water tower in Chelea, Manhattan, annual infiltration scavenger hunts of the Waldorf Astoria hotel, a pop up wine bar on an uninhabited island in the East River, a romantic retreat at an abandoned honeymoon resort in the Poconos, a photo safari in the Domino Sugar Refinery in Brooklyn, and a love motel transformation in São Paulo, Brazil, among other adventures.   

And it all started thanks to a modest <a href="http://blog.awesomefoundation.org/2012/10/14/trespass-theater-with-project-wanderlust/" target="_blank">Awesome Foundation grant</a>.
