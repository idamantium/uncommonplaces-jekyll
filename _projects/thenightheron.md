The Night Heron was a legendary, short-lived speakeasy in a dry water tower in Chelsea, Manhattan. It operated undetected for 7 week in the late winter of 2013. The proprietor, N.D. Austin, was inspired by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/nyregion/daring-enough-to-bare-it-all-for-a-new-york-swim.html" target="_blank">my adventures in water towers</a>, both wet and dry.  

I served as Head of the Brain Trust for the project, advising the build out and synthesizing insights from the project into our <a href="/projects/sextantworks/">existing design practice</a>. The Night Heron's gifting admission system, embodied by the pocket watches, was our most sophisticated manifestation of using generosity to provoke engagement and transformation in the face of certain risk.
