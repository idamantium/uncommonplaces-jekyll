After hearing about my adventures in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/nyregion/daring-enough-to-bare-it-all-for-a-new-york-swim.html" target="_blank">water towers</a>, both wet and dry, N.D. Austin was swept up by a fit of inspiration. He scouted dozens of water towers, assembled a team, and consulted everyone in his network about how to go about putting a speakeasy in one.   

I served as Head of the Brain Trust for the project, advising the build out and 7 week run, and synthesizing insights from the project into our <a href="/projects/sextantworks/">existing design practice</a>. The Night Heron's gifting admission system, embodied by the pocket watches, was our most sophisticated manifestation of using generosity to provoke transformation and wonder in the face of certain risk.
