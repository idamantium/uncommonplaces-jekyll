  		  <p>This weekend is full of birthday surprises. I’m helping orchestrate two. For my own birthday this year, I was treated to a surprise from some people very dear to me.</p>

<p>A few weeks in advance, I received this card in the mail:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3658 size-full" src="/images/2014/09/20140717_091553.jpg" alt="20140717_091553" width="2288" height="2906" /></p>

<p>(Cute acronym in the sign off.)</p>

<p>I followed the instructions and dutifully told no one, not even those I suspected of organizing it, that I had received the invitation. Sitting on the secret was incredibly delicious. At the rendezvous point on the given day, I was handed a suitcase and another envelope with instructions to go to Penn Station and board a train with the enclosed tickets. I still didn’t know where I was going. Apparently there was an envelop in the suitcase that would explain everything, but I was not to open that until I was on the train.</p>

<p>My destination was a Zen Buddhist monastery in the Catskills. I was to stay for 4 nights. <a href="http://bluecliffmonastery.org/" target="_blank">Blue Cliff Monestary</a> felt like a world away with all the mindful eating and working while the monks and nuns chattered in Vietnamese. It’s an outpost of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh" target="_blank">Thich Nhat Hanh</a>’s order. I have been meditating nearly every morning since the fall of 2013 and often lament that I just want to be left alone for a whole day at a time, which seems impossible in New York City. Sending me to Blue Cliff was a very thoughtful gift.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, and unbeknownst to my kind birthday conspirators, Blue Cliff is a defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht_Belt" target="_blank">Borscht Belt Resort</a>. The loquacious taxi driver who took me from the train station to the monestary said it was called Jeronimos back in the day. A lot of performers stayed there because it was quieter than the big resorts. Having <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2014/06/wanderlust-borscht-belt-kutchers/" target="_blank">soaked up Borscht Belt history</a> to orchestrate Wanderlust’s experience <a href="http://wanderlustprojects.com/themambo" target="_blank">“The Mambo”</a>, I took to educating all the other sutra-toting attendees about the place’s past.</p>

<p>The daily activities were less structured than you might expect from a Zen center. I was often at a loss of what to do with myself. Between sitting in meditation and silent meals, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153" target="_blank">“Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking” by Susan Cain</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transformation-Healing-Sutra-Establishments-Mindfulness-ebook/dp/B006JO1SKM/" target="_blank">“Transformation and Healing” by Thich Nhat Hanh</a>, an interpretation of the sutra on the four establishments of mindfulness. By day 3, everything I did felt like some sort of meditation. Mindfulness was contagious.</p>

<p>The birthday interventions I’m helping with this weekend weren’t hard to put together, but you have to wonder when your life will tip over into doing nothing but surprises for your favorite people. The danger seems quite real.</p>

<p>In the closing paragraph of “Transformation and Healing”, Thich Nhat Hanh shares his take on the risk and reward of perpetual birthday joy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who practice mindful living will inevitably transform themselves and their way of life. They will live a more simple life and will have more time to enjoy themselves, their friends, and their natural environment. They will have more time to offer joy to others and to alleviate their suffering. And when the time comes, they will die in peace. They will know that to die is to begin anew or just to continue with another form of life. When we live out life this way, every day is a Happy Birthday, a Happy Continuation Day.</p>
</blockquote>
