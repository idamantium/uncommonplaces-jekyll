  		  <p>The <a href="http://www.florence-expo.com/pages/page.asp?idcontent=113">“Life Beyond Tourism”</a> festival in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi last week, organized by Faculty of Media Art at the <a href="http://www.art.edu.ge/English.html">Tbilisi State Academy of Art</a> as part of the Degree &amp; Professionalism project, attempted to bring together international art and design school alumni to present their thesis projects and get a taste of Georgian culture. The timing was unfortunate as many of the European participants could not come give the volcanic ash shutting down huge swaths of air space. Luckily for us participants from <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons the New School for Design</a>, our flight went through Istanbul, so there were no problems getting to Tbilisi. The only other foreigners to make it to the festival were Armenian participants from the <a href="http://www.ysuac.am/indexen.html">Yerevan State University of Architecture and Construction</a> who arrived by land.</p>

<p>I had no idea what to expect in Georgia. I was recommended for the festival because my Parsons thesis, <a href="http://portfolio.idaimages.com/#60117/Lilliput-A-Photographic-Travelogue">Lilliput: A Photographic Travelogue</a>, is pertinent to the festival theme. Four Parsons alumni and Academic Dean Lydia Matthews were treated to a week of sightseeing at various historic locations around Tbilisi, a performance of traditional dance and song, amazing food and wine, and an opportunity to see what Georgian art and design students are up to.</p>

<p>For most of the festival participants, “life beyond tourism” meant cultural preservation. Research papers from Georgian academics wavered between enthusiasm for the unrealized tourism potential of Georgia’s cultural heritage and concern for the preservation of this heritage should tourism take off. Georgia does not have a robust tourism industry, but most of the academics and artist who spoke demonstrated a keen desired for the economic and cultural stimulus that tourism can bring.</p>

<p>The student work at the festival was architecture and animation heavy. Architecture projects ranged from proposed museums to elaborate renderings of the mathematical nature of Georgian churches. Animation work retold classic stories, like Rashomon or The Metamorphosis, or re-imagined major works from art history.</p>

<p>Among those who could not attend the festival in person thanks to the volcanic ash was the main sponsor, Paolo Del Bianco of the <a href="http://www.fondazione-delbianco.org/inglese/index_i.htm">Florence Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation</a>, so he Skyped in. I was totally charmed by the spectacle of Mr. Del Bianco greeting the festival attendees with a double-handed wave as the Georgians waved back. Even though the two-way feed was live and projected large across the wall, a sense of distance was palpable in the gestures as well as the affectionate formality of the conversation. Skype was frequently referred to as an “amazing new technology.”</p>

<p>Coming from Parsons, it was surprising for me to see how much the Georgian students and their professors were reaching into the past for inspiration. Parsons’ emphasis on innovation can leave students with little or no grounding in historical context. This does not seem to be a problem for students of the Art Academy of Tbilisi who frequently made use of local millennium old precedents when creating their work.</p>

<p>Viewing their work, I struggled to glean what is happening in Georgia now and how creative design practices are addressing these circumstances. Maybe this is more a concern of the contemporary art scene in Tbilisi rather than that of the Academy. On this front, I felt like those of us from Parsons had something to offer. While our projects might not be as squarely grounded in historical precedents as the work of the Georgian students, we consistently made an effort to use knowledge of the past to provide innovations for the present.</p>

Realizing that sustainability goes beyond materials used, Georgeana is developing a resource for sustainable business practices for New York City’s Garment District.</p>

This project lead to the publication of Duncan’s first book, <a href="http://duncantonatiuh.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/dear-primo/">Dear Primo, A Letter to My Cousin</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://portfolio.idaimages.com/#60117/Lilliput-A-Photographic-Travelogue"><img src="http://c0573862.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/1/0/958/60117/benedettoiThbn1.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="left" /></a>I presented Liliput: A Photographic Travelogue, where to I use pre-digital precedents for storytelling about travel, namely the Baroque Cabinet of Curiosities, to innovate on visual storytelling with digital media and reproduce the comforting disorientation of travel in an interactive travel narrative.</p>

<p>Both Parsons The New School for Design and The Art Academy of Tbilisi stand to gain much from further collaboration and exchange given each school’s different strengths and methods.</p>

<p>Parsons Academic Dean Lydia Matthews has visit Georgia 6 times, and it was her passion for the place the brought us there. I hope that more Parsons students and alumni will be able learn from Georgia’s art and design scene thanks to her efforts as a liaison.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the Tbilisi State Academy of Art for sponsoring Parsons alumni to attend, and thanks especially to the Dean of the Faculty of Art Media, Nana Iashvili, for the superhuman effort in organizing the festival.</p>
