  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Over the past couple of weeks, I have been teaching a workshop for <a href="http://www.internews.org/">Internews</a> Ethiopia on photojournalism and HIV/AIDS coverage. Internews works to strengthen local reporting by offering training and small grants to journalists.</p>

<p><a href="/images//2010/05/suits21.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1955" title="suits2" src="/images//2010/05/suits21-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" /></a>Throughout my time here, people have urged me to work with the local newspapers to improve their photographic coverage. It wasn’t hard to see why. The newspapers seems to be filled with ambiguous shots of men in suits. This constituted some 80% of the photographs published. The rest of the pictures were predominantly stock images of tourist sights and the occasional photo of an emaciated child. Talk about a limited visual vocabulary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.internews.org/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1924 alignright" title="internews" src="/images//2010/05/internews.jpg" alt="" width="115" height="117" /></a>It was great to partner with Internews as the team there is smart and well versed in the challenges of working with Ethiopian news organizations. Since Internews Ethiopia’s focus is on health reporting and HIV/AIDS, I spent a lot of time in the workshop stressing issues of sigma and informed consent. The stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia is staggering. Reporting on these issues should strive to ameliorate the suffering of affected people, and it takes time and patience to understand what kinds of pictures will do this. Photographs have an amazing power to strengthen the emotional bond between people, but in order to do that photos must convey insight and intimacy. No wonder that so many HIV+ people are reluctant to be reveal themselves to the camera as it could easily make them vulnerable to the negative impact of HIV/AIDS stigma.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>A large component of the workshop entailed mentored field trips.  It was a lot of work on Internews’ part to find organizations willing to let the photojournalists report on them. So you can imagine how disconcerting it was when, after discussing issues of consent and stigma for a few days in a classroom setting and seeing Internews staff spend hours on the phone to secure access to locations, the photographers rushed in to get pictures as soon as we arrived. They failed to introduce themselves, explain what they were up to or ask if the people consented to having their photographs taken. This is probably one of many bad habits they’ve learned working at newspapers. (“Get the picture fast, and get back to the office to file!”)  Foregrounding consent and visual storytelling constituted a complete 180 from the way these photographers work on a daily basis.  I insisted that everyone slow down and focus on the story they came to tell, that of “positive living” with HIV/AIDS. They moved away from the habits they had formed at work, and many fruitful conversations between the photographers and the members of the organization ensued. The photographers got good information about the members and found out who was willing to be photographed and who wasn’t.</p>

<p>The lesson was clearly sinking in by the second day of field trips when we ran into problems with one of the locations. It was a workplace where employees had a high risk of contracting HIV since they were far from home, worked in close confines with members of the opposite sex, earned low wages and had little or no formal education. The owner of the establishment gave us permission to photograph under the condition that we did not mention HIV/AIDS while we were there. No talk about risk, intervention or people’s status. This put us in a bind. Internews is producing an exhibition of the photographs from the workshop. Photographs of the workers would be published to tell the story of risk factors for contracting HIV/AIDS. We had no way of discussing with the subjects the context in which  photographs of them would be used, so it was impossible to get their informed consent. Then again, our choices of location were extremely limited. Of the many establishments and organizations asked, few were willing to let us photograph there. I opened the question up to the workshop participants to let them decide if we would like to take this opportunity given the limitations or look for another place to photograph. After a brief discussion, they unanimously agreed that this was not a good scenario and that we should look for other options. Luckily, the other option we did find turned out to be really wonderful.</p>

<p>The experience got me thinking a lot about the nature of informed consent. The photojournalists in the workshop initially understood consent as something they had to get from their subjects. This is a sentiment common among photojournalists regardless of where they are from or where they are working. It seems to me that a great opportunity is lost here, especially when working with vulnerable populations. Informed consent requires as much giving on the photographer’s part as it does on the subject’s. The result is an agreement. In arriving at that agreement of what kinds of photographs will create the most understanding and empathy without endangering the subjects, the photographer has to give up their authority over the photograph. Okay, fine, we’ve crossed the (exceedingly blurry and ever gray) line between photojournalism and documentary photography. A five-day workshop over the course of two weeks probably isn’t enough time to learn how to cross that line gracefully. It was enough time to see a remarkable change of attitude among the local photojournalists about what photographs can do and the kind of relationships between subject and photographs needed to realize these possibilities. I hope the newspaper editors can make it to the exhibition in June so consideration of these issues can spread to the rest of their organizations.</p>
