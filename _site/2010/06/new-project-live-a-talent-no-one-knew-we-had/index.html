    <p>One of the major contributions I’ve made to <a href="http://www.suddenflowers.org/">Sudden Flowers Productions</a> has been an introduction to the internet and digital interactive narrative. We just completed the web project that resulted from these classes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idaimages.com/SF/talent/">A Talent No One Knew We Had</a> is a collection of stories from Sudden Flowers Productions on their contribution to the 9th anniversary of <a href="http://www.hopeforchildrenethiopia.org/">Hope For Children</a>, the community organization many of them call home.</p>

<p>While most of Sudden Flowers’ members have experience using computers for word processing and video editing, few of them have any experience using the internet. We played interactive fiction, browsed interactive photography projects and edited Wikipedia entries. After each session of playing/looking/editing, we would discuss what the messages of the piece were and how the format helped conveyed those messages. They were clearly catching on when Adane observed that, “The story doesn’t happen on its own. You make the story by playing it.”</p>

<p>I taught them basic HTML and CSS. They were memorized by the process of writing a few lines of text code and seeing how the browser interpreted it into visuals and interactive elements (very much as I was when I first started learning this stuff!). When it came time to actually make something, I chose to build on their existing strength in telling their own personal stories developed through years of producing autobiographical films. They had recently put a lot of work into the 9th anniversary celebration of Hope for Children, the community organization/orphanage that they are beneficiaries of. I invited them to write stories about that experience, and we designed a website that showcases those stories.</p>

<p>To produce the piece, I did most of the coding myself, but I updated the group on my progress periodically and explained how everything was working. They pestered me incessantly to get the project done. At first this pestering was surprising. Usually I was the one pestering them (to get to meetings on time, to think critically, to make stuff). I realized that they were just super excited to have the site go live. They are very proud to have the work online for the world to see.</p>

<p>I hope to get an Amharic version of the site up so that the site can be enjoyed by the small but growing Amharic speaking community online.</p>
