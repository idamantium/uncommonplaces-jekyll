  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The <a href="http://www.differentgames.org/" target="_blank">Different Games conference</a> this past April was a great big love fest for games being more inclusive in terms of who makes them, who is in them, and who plays them. It was an honor to advise on the conference. The New York games community was ready and eager for an event that not only celebrated diversity in games but critically engaged with what that means and what we want going forward. The conference leadership, <a href="http://www.lainenooney.com/" target="_blank">Laine Nooney</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahschoemann.com/">Sarah Schoemann</a>, did a phenomenal job balancing a multiplicity of interests and concerns in the short program.</p>

<h3 id="who8217s-an-expert-on-sexism">Who’s an Expert on Sexism?</h3>

<p>I was asked to lead <a href="http://www.differentgames.org/d3-breakout-until-the-revolution-comes-navigating-sexism-in-the-industry-jacobs-building-room-417/" target="_blank">a breakout session</a> for women working in games, which I called “Before the Revolution Comes: Navigating Sexism in the Game Industry” along with <a href="http://varelidi.com" target="_blank">Chloe Varelidi</a> of Mozilla. I reached out to a number of women for input on their experiences of sexism in the industry and what they might want a breakout session on the topic to accomplish. To my surprise, many women declined my invitation to connect over this issue stating that they are not experts in sexism. I was baffled the first time this happened and completely disoriented when it emerged as a pattern.</p>

<p>Why do you need to be an expert on sexism to discuss your experiences of it? Did women think they weren’t experiencing sexism? Were they scared to discuss the topic give the heated and disturbing episodes around PyCon and Anita Sarkeesian’s Kickstarter campaign? Was I fundamentally missing the core issue in my approach? Some of the feedback I receive suggested that the breakout description in the program might be too edgy. I rewrote it a few days before the conference even though I knew that the description wasn’t at fault for whatever core issues was playing out.</p>

<h3 id="designing-awkward-moments-of-connection">Designing Awkward Moments of Connection</h3>

<p>All of this shuffling and second guessing meant that I arrived at the conference without a plan of what I was going to do at the session itself. Luckily, <a href="http://www.maryflanagan.com/" target="_blank">Mary Flanagan</a>’s keynote address offered real inspiration. She mentioned one of <a href="http://www.tiltfactor.org/" target="_blank">Tiltfactor</a>’s card games called <a href="http://www.tiltfactor.org/awkward-moment" target="_blank">Awkward Moment</a>, which presents players with awkward situations and a hand of possible responses. With a portion of the Awkward Moment cards representing situations of racial and gender stereotyping, the game subtly makes players aware of their own biases.</p>

<p>Given the taboo nature of talking about sexism in the games industry, Awkward Moment offered a model of intervention that could break the ice on an issue people didn’t know how to approach. When I initially conceived of the session, I thought people would want concrete strategies for addressing sexism. The tension around the issue was so high that just opening up about it in the first place would probably be a huge benefit for most attendees.</p>

<p>Chloe and I used text from response cards in the Tiltfactor game for stock response cards. We designed prompts for writing about awkward moments of sexism while working in games. We wanted breakout attendees to think concretely about specific encounters they might have been in. Prompts included “You need to say what’s wrong with the design concept that was just presented for the new game project”, “You arrive early at the tech meetup”, “A Facebook friend enthusiastically posted the PS Vita ad on their wall”.</p>

<p>The breakout session was well attended with over 40 people (2/3 women, 1/3 men), packing the classroom at NYU-Poly. After introductions, people broke into pairs to write awkward moments. Chloe and I gathered the moments and shuffled them. The room was divided into two groups and given a set seach, generated almost entirely by the people in attendance, to play. The cards were full of difficult situations of being hit on, sidelined and undervalued.</p>

<p>The room filled with tender eagerness as the groups settled into the game. Afterwords, several attendees, men especially, approached Chloe and I to thank us for the session.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="what-worked-opening-up-while-hiding">What Worked? Opening Up While Hiding</h3>

<p>The original game of Awkward Moment is carefully balanced to introduce just the right number of topical awkward moments about biases amid more general awkward moments.The balance creates awareness without resistance in the player. This is the subtle brilliance of what Tiltfactor has created. Where Awkward Moment is designed to create awareness of biases, “Before the Revolution Comes” was designed to confront the two biggest challenges that arose as I planned the session: opening up and connecting.</p>

<p>Women were reluctant to open up about their experiences. Leaving the prompt to write awkward moments open ended allowed participants to write something personal, specific or general as they were so inclined. By collecting and shuffling the cards, who wrote what card was obfuscated, adding an additional layer of safety for writing something specific if one felt compelled. The risk of exposure was minimized while the possibility for connection was high. Playing the game with cards created by people in that same room facilitated a palatable intimacy. People groaned in pained recognition as awkward moments were served up and laughed sympathetically as the responses people played were just as futile as they might experience in real life. These weren’t a stock set of awkward encounters. They were inspired by the experiences of the people playing together.</p>

<p>I was impressed by how many men showed up for the session. Given how seemingly comfortable their participation was thoughout and how moved they were after, it seems that the benefits of opening up while hiding for the women extended to the men. Through the balance of intimacy and anonymity mediated by play, the men could witness a recounting of sexism that might otherwise be too uncomfortably specific or confrontational.</p>

<p>Attendees relived the damaging experiences of sexism in a safe, supportive environment. Opening up just enough to create the game materials and connecting over play created the space for catharsis. This approach works for a group that is already interested in engaging with the touchy topic at hand. If it were a general audience from the game community at the workshop, the content of the cards might not have been so consistently topical and gameplay might have gotten uncomfortable in the midst of so many challenging issues coming up.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

<p>Mary Flanagan and <a href="http://cpandfriends.com/" target="_blank">Celia Pearce</a> participated in the session and showed great interest in moving the project forward with an official mod of Awkward Moment for the games industry. I hope that both the breakout session design and the game mod can move forward. Given the resistance I experienced in the lead up to the workshop, I was totally blown away by the eagerness of everyone who did attend and the effectiveness of the activity. The games community first needs to drudge up its own biases in order to confront them. A sexism in games version of Awkward Moment would be wonderful for that. For those who have dealt with sexist encounters repeatedly as they try to create work they love and believe in, a space for healing and connection will give us the strength to carry on with our ambitions.</p>
