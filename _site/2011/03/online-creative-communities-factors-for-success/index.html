  		  <p>Creative communities online embrace new business models to give makers a means of sustaining themselves financially through their creative output. I had the opportunity to research creative communities for a client project by looking closely at four such communities.<br />
<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2211" title="creativecommunities04" src="/images//2011/03/creativecommunities04.png" alt="" width="146" height="209" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.threadless.com/">Threadless</a> crowdsources trendy t-shirt designs</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> provides ecommerce tools for crafts people and makers of all stripes</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/">Photoshelter</a> does something similar for photographers</li>
  <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> offers hosting space and distribution tools for video and filmmakers</li>
</ul>

<p>While each of these sites operate in very different markets, they do similar things to sustain the community drawing on their services. Here are some of the practices that make these communities vibrant and productive:</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>1. Embrace the Values that Motivate Creative Production</strong></p>

<p>The values that motivate people to create constitute the most important force bringing the community together. Economic incentives may inspire collaboration and entrepreneurialism, but the resilience of the community is build on personal values that brought people to creative endeavors in the first place. Successful creative communities proudly display those values and develop an aesthetic to communicate them. This is evident both in the kinds of work produced by the community and the auxiliary activities the community embraces.</p>

<p>Three great examples of this include <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/craftivism/">Etsy’s Craftivism Blog</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/awards">Vimeo’s film festival</a> and <a href="http://www.threadless.com/loves">Thredless Design Challenges</a>. The opportunities that each of these endeavors offer speak to the unique impetus driving each community.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/awards"><img title="VimeoFilmFestival" src="/images//2011/03/VimeoFilmFestival.png" alt="" width="420" /></a></p>

<p><strong>2. Offer Learning Resources and Update Them Frequently</strong></p>

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 8.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-indent: 28.0px; font: 13.0px Optima} -->
<p>Tutorials and educational features encourage learning and constantly upgrading skills. The educational resources simultaniously lower the barrier to entry by showing novices the way and sets standards high by asking members to constantly improve their skills rather than resting on their laurels.</p>

<p>Two examples of this are <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/search/title/shop-makeover/">Etsy’s Shop Makeovers</a> and Photoshelter’s ever evolving and expanding offering of free <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/help/tut/video">tutorials</a> and <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/about/webinar">webinars</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/search/title/shop-makeover/"><img title="EtsyShopMakeOver" src="/images//2011/03/EtsyShopMakeOver.png" alt="" width="420" /></a></p>

<p><strong>3. Turn Successes into Role Models to Emulate</strong></p>

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 8.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-indent: 28.0px; font: 13.0px Optima} -->
<p>Profiles of successful members of the community show what success looks like with insight into the path taken to get there. Such profiles can serve to communicate the value of the community to potential entrepreneurs and creatives. In the case of Threadless, many of their most successful designers used the platform to launch their design careers. This is true with Etsy as well. To deliver value to the community, role models need to get a little vulnerable by showing their process so others can emulate their success. Photoshelter uses webinars and their blog to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.photoshelter.com/2011/03/how-four-successful-photographers-sell-their-print.html"><img title="PhotoshelterRoleModels" src="/images//2011/03/PhotoshelterRoleModels.png" alt="" width="420" /></a></p>

<p><strong>4. Empower Aficionados</strong></p>

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 8.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-indent: 28.0px; font: 13.0px Optima} -->
<p>In addition to creating original content such as tutorials and featured success stories, successful creative communities provide tools for aficionados to strut their stuff on their terms for the benefit of the whole community. Sometimes empowering aficionados is as simple as maintaining discussion boards where current issues facing the community can be discussed frankly.  Other times, it entails leveraging the insight of aficionados toward specific projects.</p>

<p>Vibrant message boards abound on these sites, and this is often the place where aficionados make their expertise available. <a href="http://www.threadless.com/blogs/critiques">Threadless Critiques</a> is an example of a specialized message board meeting a specific need of the community. If a designer wants input on their design before submitting it for voting, they can post the current design and get feedback from experienced designers, updating the post with revisions until it’s ready for submission.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.threadless.com/blogs/critiques"><img title="ThreadlessCritiques" src="/images//2011/03/ThreadlessCritiques.png" alt="" width="420" /></a></p>

<p><strong>5. Enable Innovation</strong></p>

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 8.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-indent: 28.0px; font: 13.0px Optima} -->
<p>Truly productive creative communities will quickly outgrow the forms of creative output that brought them together.  Their collective energy will spawn new business models and products. The community must embrace and innovate on these developments to keep pace with members’ ambitions.</p>

<p>Photoshelter is a prime example of this. They attempted to create a sales service much like a traditional photography agency to represent the photographers using the hosting service.  That effort <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/about/index/news/20080911">didn’t work out</a>, but Photoshelter continues to roll out new features for different ways to do business, such as WordPress integration through a <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/mkt/gpp/">partnership with Graph Paper Press</a> and a recently launched <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/signup/vendor">print order service</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/website-examples"><img title="PhotoshelterSiteTemplates" src="/images//2011/03/screen-capture-1.png" alt="" width="420" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Here, I’ve looked at a small selection of creative communities. Do you know of others that also make use of these methods or that defy them? And what about online collaborations around knowledge production and education? Efforts like <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a> seem to be sustained by a different set of factors. How do they compare?</p>
