  <article class="post-content">
    <p><a href="http://www.climatecentre.org/">The Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre</a> asked me to teach participatory video to a community of farmers of Wage Warage in north western Ethiopia this past fall. Justin Benn of <a href="http://www.vivo-media.net/">Vivo Media</a> produced a micro-documentary about the workshop to help the Red Cross reproduce this method elsewhere:</p>

<p>The goal of the workshop was to produce inspirational videos to help Ethiopian farmers collaborate with the Red Cross in locally adapting to the risks of climate change. Wage Warage had successfully implemented numerous climate risk adaptation programs over the course of a year with support from the Red Cross. The community was reaping the benefits in the form of better harvests, more stable household incomes and better working conditions, especially for women.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>The Red Cross wanted the farmers of Wage Wargaje to demonstrate the benefits of the programs to other Ethiopian farmers so that they would be motivated to proactively confront climate change as well. Ethiopia’s contribution to global climate change is negligible, but devastating droughts and soil erosion are threatening the livelihoods of many rural communities. The Red Cross is trying to prevent humanitarian disasters by teaching the farmers to adapt to the impacts locally. Participatory Video offers a means of creating visual evidence and personal stories designed by Wage Warage to reach farmers like them. They made four short videos in four days. Have a look:</p>

<p>**What is Participatory Video?<br />
**<br />
Participatory Video (PV) is a creative process where a group or community with otherwise limited experience in producing media makes a video. The process of making the video is as important if not more important than the final product. This distinction sets PV apart from documentary film or promotional media. The reason for making the video is often linked with empowerment, be that through articulating concerns to legislators, resolving conflict within the community through a creative process, or reaching out to similar communities through mediated narrative. Participatory Video often happens through a collaboration between outside advocates or media makers and the community. Outside advocates serve as support as the community scripts and shoots their videos.</p>

<p><strong>About The Workshop</strong></p>

<p>The Climate Centre’s Pablo Suarez compulsively experiments with different communication techniques to help students, his colleagues in the scientific community and rural communities in developing countries understand the many interrelated facets of climate change. He put together a team to give Participatory Video a try with Wage Warage in Ethiopia with the support of the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Netherlands Red Cross. With a clear intended audience and desired outcomes that matched up with the strengths of the chosen medium, the project showed a great deal of promise, and I was glad be part of the team as the Participatory Video trainer. It was a pleasure to work with filmmaker Justin Benn to make the workshop a success.</p>

<p>I drew heavily from <a href="http://insightshare.org/">Insight Share’s resources</a> in planning the workshop. Insight Share has some 7 years of experience teaching Participatory Video. The exercises they outline have been tested and refined in diverse contexts. I highly recommend the <a href="http://insightshare.org/resources/pv-handbook">free handbook</a> they provide on their site if you are considering any community media project of this nature.</p>

<p>The workshop ran for four days with three groups of farmers working in teams. The first day and a half of the workshop consisted of introductory exercises with the camera and planning the short videos. The following day and a half consisted of shooting. The last day was given to paper edits and screening raw footage.</p>

<p>Even though the community exists off the grid with no regular access to media beyond radio, let alone the means of producing media, the workshop participants took to the process quickly and confidently. They were grateful for the Red Cross’ efforts and eager to serve as roll models for other communities facing similar problems. By the end of the workshop, the farmers were independently going out to shoot B roll and redo scenes they were unsatisfied with. Everything went remarkably smoothly despite having such a short time to work.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>

<p>The video on fuel efficient stoves was screened at <a href="http://www.cc2010.mx/">COP16</a>. The Ethiopian Red Cross Society is working on distributing the films and integrating them into their training programs, which is invariably trickier than international distribution as I found <a href="http://blog.idaimages.com/2010/10/22/ethiopia-fulbright-summary/">researching Sudden Flowers Productions</a>, a youth film collective in Ethiopia’s capital. The response so far from Ethiopian Red Cross staff has been overwhelming enthusiasm. We are exploring ways to train local Red Cross employees to run Participatory Video programs themselves.</p>
