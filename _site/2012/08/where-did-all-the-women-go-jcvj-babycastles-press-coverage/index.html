  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Below is a letter I wrote to the author of Capital New York’s <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/08/6481092/creating-new-worlds-old-jean-claude-van-damme-movies-new-york-gaming">Creating New Worlds (From Old Jean-Claude Van Damme Movies) with New York Game Collective Babycastles</a>. Given all the attention Babycastles is getting for the <a href="http://babycastles.com/summit">MAD FUN Summit</a>, it’s important to make this discussion public.</p>

<p>The game jam that Kaho Abe, Ben Johnson, Matt Parker, Ramsey Nasser and I organized was a huge success. <a href="http://www.jeanclaudevanjam.com/">The Jean-Claude Van Jam</a> brought 9 teams together ( 8 in New York at <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam</a> and 1 in Mexico) to make games inspired by Jean-Claude Van Damme’s film repertoire.</p>

<p>The jam was inspired by <a href="http://gil.cite.poly.edu/?post_type=event&amp;p=1062">Kaho Abe’s Indie Tech Talk at the NYU-Poly Game Innovation Lab</a>. I scheduled Kaho to talk because, while she has an adoring fab base, we rarely hear her discuss her work publicly. This is the case with many of my favorite technologists, women especially. Few of us knew about <a href="http://kahoabe.net/?p=564">the connection between Kaho’s games and action movies</a>. It was at a meeting of the <a href="http://eyebeam.org/research/game-design">Eyebeam Game Research Group</a> that the enthusiasm for this connection took the form of a game jam. Ramsey Nasser coined the title, I registered the URL, and we were off.</p>

<p>Several members of the media were at the jam and <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/08/6481092/creating-new-worlds-old-jean-claude-van-damme-movies-new-york-gaming">the article that came out in Capital New York</a> was the most extensive. The problems with the article that I point out below are endemic in coverage of indie games in general. If this particular journalist gets extra flack, I’ll consider publishing this letter to be a failure. What I want changed is the whole trend of women’s work and voices being overlooked in games and charismatic leaders getting disproportionate credit where whole teams hauled ass to make awesome happen. This article is a symptom of the trend.</p>

<p>I am missing the MAD FUN Summit to go to <a href="http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/">Burning Man</a>, the ultimate radial experiment in temporary community which will certainly be fraught with new challenges on the road to inclusivity, diversity and creative expression. After working with Babycastles for nearly 2 years, new challenges are looking pretty attractive.</p>

<p>To any journalists covering MAD FUN, please be rigorous and honest about what the summit accomplishes, how, and by whose efforts. I hope the news will pleasantly surprised me when I emerge from the Nevada desert in a few weeks. If not, I’m all ears for figuring out what we can do to build on Babycastles beautiful, wacky contributions to independent games to deliver on our ideals of diversity and inclusivity.</p>

  <p>Hi Jill,</p>

  <p>Thanks again for coming out to the Jean Claude Van Jam this past weekend and publishing such a thorough article.</p>

  <p>As an organizer of the event, it was frustrating to see that no women were quoted in the article despite the fact that there was a strong turn out of women participants and you spoke to the two female organizers (of the 5 organizers in total) extensively.</p>

  <p>Quoting Syed (who was not involved in organizing this jam or the event that inspired it) as advocating diversity in games is a circuitous way of getting the point across. Everyone quoted in the article is a male nerd.</p>

  <p>We had a diverse team put this event together. The turn out was certainly the most diverse of any Babycastles game jam. Women were integral parts of two of the winning teams and the racial makeup of those teams was also markedly diverse. There was much evidence for why the jam was an oasis of inclusivity among the white, male nerdfest that is most of games. You did a great job indicating why the jam was successful for the diversity and weirdness of the games produced. The gender diversity at this jam was a unique achievement for Babycastles, and I lement that it was not part of your coverage.</p>

  <p>Women are often overlooked in the independent games scene in all possible roles – players, designers, producers, etc. I encourage you to use your influential role as a member of the media to include women’s work and women’s voices when covering games. I, for one, need that kind of support and visability to remain invested in keeping games diverse, weird and inclusive.</p>

  <p>Best,<br />
Ida C. Benedetto<br />
