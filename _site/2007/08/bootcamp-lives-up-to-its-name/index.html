  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am finishing out my second of three weeks at <a href="http://bootcamp.parsons.edu" target="_blank">bootcamp</a>. A good night’s sleep is about 5 hours and I now understand the migraine my mom complained about when me and my three siblings were little. The pace is sickening, but I am learning a lot. I put up a web page for my work in the Design and Technology department. I coded it all by hand! <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/" target="_blank">Look!</a> There is not a ton of content, but the design and making it all work in CSS was challenging enough. We’ve also been doing little exercises with a programing language called <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>. Again, it’s all hand coding, but we are allowed to cut and paste a bit more with the Processing because it’s much harder to soak in than XHTML and CSS. Here are some examples of what I’ve done:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~miulo/applet/dotHack.html" target="_blank">dotHack</a> (in collaboration with Megan Iulo)</li>
  <li><a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/blog/files/DravingTool2.html" target="_blank">DrawingTool2</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/blog/files/kisses.html">VirtualKisses</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They take a moment to load as they are java applets. DrawingTool is interactive, so click on it.</p>

<p>For the final project, which is due on Friday, each student needs to create a web page about a social issues and create something with processing about it that will be published on the web page. I am using this opportunity to create a web presence for my postcard correspondence project between the fair trade farmers in Guatemala and India. I hope to get back to India in January, so I’ve got to get my act together with this. The web page part will not be that hard. I’ve got some scaffolding up <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/bootcamp/">here</a>. I am extremely concerned about the Processing part. So far, programming has been a lot of fun when it’s shapes and motion, but now that I have to actualize something coherent around qualitative content, I’m stumped. The code teacher is pretty awesome, so I know he can help, but everyone is in the same boat it seems, and there is only so much time to pull this off. I was thinking of doing a very paired down version of <a href="http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/thedumpster/" target="_blank">The Dumpster</a> project, which presents qualitative info from blogs about teen break ups. I am thinking of a simple set of objects that will pull up postcards when you click on them and show links to other postcards or content through keywords that processing can associate. It will be a miracle or wiser people’s handiwork to pull this off by Thursday night. I am making time to blog right now as selective procrastination. I have an applet of a bunch of <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/blog/files/FinalTest1.html" target="_blank">uncontrollable coffee beans</a> bouncing all over the place. I can’t manage to reign them in or associate them with content.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I have had no social life. None. But I have committed myself to a photo assignment from the paper tomorrow! No sleep in sigh….</p>
