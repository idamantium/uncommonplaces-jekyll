  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This week I have been working at the family business’s office in mid-town. Two years ago I worked in the Dumbo office for about 8 months. That convinced me to go back to school. The midtown office is much more mellow, with the characters not so obnoxiously colorful. The business manages waste paper and several rental properties around town. The previous accountant did a terrible job. She was recently let off and the new accountant is trying to sort out the mess. My sister, who recently graduated Boston College, and I are her guinea pigs. I spend most of the day pounding old calculators trying to find the problematic item on accounts and records that don’t add up. When I am not doing that, I am pulling bills and other records from the monster of a file system. The business has been in the family since my great great great someone or other came over on the boat in the 1880′s, so this is old style. I find it amusing. For a few weeks, it’s a fine gig to fall back on. I’ll try and do a mini-photo essay on it next week. There’s a true crime book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Takedown-Undercover-Detective-Brought-Billion-Dollar/dp/0425192997/ref=sr_1_1/002-6553577-3778456?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1188147133&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Takedown</a> about how the city, in cooperation with my family members, had undercovers in the business to bust a mafia garbage scheme in the early 1990′s. Working in the office again has me interested in reading it, and doing some other general research on the family history. All day I am confronted with hitorical photographs of the garbage trucks and factories in the first half of the century. The images are going to hell in their ill fitted frames and no one knows where the negatives or glass plates are.</p>

<p>In the spirit of old time New York, I took Chris Nesbit, a friend from the photo department at Parsons, to <a href="http://www.mcsorleysnewyork.com/" target="_blank">McSorley’s Old Ale House</a> on 7th st.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>I had only been their once prior, but that was before reading <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/03/reviews/010603.03breslit.html" target="_blank">Joseph Mitchell</a>‘s short story. Established in 1854, the Irish ale house has a lot of history, which is dripping from the wall in framed photographs and newspaper clippings. The look and feel has changed minimal if we are to judge from photographs. It’s a bit of a tourist’s attraction nowadays. By 5pm on Friday, it had filled up with students and young neighborhood locals. The huge wooden tables would force a certain sociability, but the bar tender insisted that Chris and I get up and take the smaller table in the window. He thought we were on a date. The man was Irish, in his 60′s with silver hair, wearing a blue smock that buttoned down the front. He congratulated Chris on finding a red head. After a few beers, I dragged Chris around to my favorite former haunts. He is working on a <a href="http://webspace.newschool.edu/~Nesbc378//new/photos.html" target="_blank">photograph project</a> of drawing the past buildings onto current photographs of the places. I showed him where the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/nyregion/thecity/24eleg.html?ex=1188273600&amp;en=caad52db624b990c&amp;ei=5070" target="_blank">Church of All Nations</a> used to be off Bowery and Houston. Google Maps hasn’t updated yet to show the high end residential building that now replaces it as well as the two buildings that faced Bowery.</p>

  I had a good time in the summer of 2002 hanging out with friend that squatted the former community center. The costumes from the theater were still around so we played dress up and swung on the rope swings in the performance space. Across the street from where it used to be is now a Whole Paycheck, I mean Whole Foods. Gross.

  We also went to Punjab at 114 E. 1st Street to get some good cheep Indian food and sit on a stoop to watch the sunset over Houston. The cabbies go to Punjab because not only is it cheep, but there is plenty of parking on this last block of 1st street where it runs into Houston. We got a bowl of rice with #1 and #3 and two chais for $5. I hadn&#8217;t been there since cold weather and was distraught to find that, sitting on the stoop a few doors down, the view was obstructed by not one but two screeching, scraping new high end residencies. One of them is right across the street. I feel like a curmudgeon, old beyond my time, talking about how it used to be and how this change is just shameful. I do feel like the neighborhood is being lost to me though. So sad.

  To continue the theme of ending posts with birthday wishes, John Tarleton turned 40 over the weekend. He is the backbone of the <a href="http://nyc.indymedia.org" target="_blank">New York City Indymedia Center</a>. I worked with Indymedia about a year and a half ago and saw John in action often. He does amazing work. The team at Indymedia gave him a cook book, with an epithet suggesting that he would need it as his live branches beyond the IMC! We&#8217;re all looking out for you John.
