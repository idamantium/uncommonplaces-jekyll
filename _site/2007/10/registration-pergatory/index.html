  		  <p>I am a <a href="http://www.parsons.edu/apply/undergrad_special.aspx" target="_blank">BAFA</a> student at <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">The New School</a>. This means that I am earning two undergraduate degrees, a BA and a BFA, in five years through two different school at The New School University (<a href="http://www.parsons.newschool.edu/" target="_blank">Parsons</a> and <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/" target="_blank">Eugene Lang</a>). While I love this program as it allows be to be rigorous in both liberal arts and visual arts, the bureaucratic havoc I need to push through is maddening, especially during registration. The requirements shift a bit for BAFA students, but no one seems to agree on how exactly. I exacerbate the confusion by being a transfer student, by majoring in a new department at Lang, and by changing departments at Parsons. If there is a rule to bend, I have probably bent it over and tied it in a knot. These knots are the footing in the rope I climb to eventually make it through undergrad. While talking to my history adviser <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=1758" target="_blank">Paul Ross</a> about what to take next semester, he paused and asked, “So after this, you have <a href="http://www.awholenother.com/" target="_blank">a whole ‘nother</a> year?” He just cackled when I said yes. “Man, you’re going to be well educated.”</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent a few hours between different advising offices.</p>

<p>Office A – to confirm that I did not need to take university lecture courses since I transfered to the New School as a sophomore. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>Office B – to find out what the requirements are for Histoy, as it’s a new concentration, and if it is really going to be a problem that I don’t have enough lower level courses. We are assuming it will be okay.</p>

<p>Office C – to figure out what I need to take in Design &amp; Technology next semester. No notes or paperwork had been passed onto this office though, so I was a totally anomaly and sent elsewhere.</p>

<p>Office D – to find out where my files from the Photography Department (my previous major at Parsons) went. We still don’t know.</p>

<p>Office E – to get information that should have gone to office C and try and track down Photography Department file.</p>

<p>I now have a rough idea of what I should take next semester to keep on track for graduating in May ’09.</p>
