  		  <p>Over the weekend I saw <a href="http://www.filmforum.org/films/lake.html" target="_blank">Lake of Fire</a>, a recent documentary by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kaye_(director)" target="_blank">Tony Kaye</a> about the struggle over abortion in America. The work is in black and white, and would have been unbearable in color because of the graphic content. Two full abortions are shown, in addition to crime scene images from several murders of doctors who performed abortion. All of this is shot and sequenced with photographic sophistication that I rarely, if ever, have seen in a documentary.</p>

<p><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/10/03/arts/02fire600.jpg" width="500" /></p>

<p>Kaye charts two things through the piece, working in opposite directions with their intensity. First is the Christian right’s crusade over abortion. This campaign, it’s political and financial underpinnings, are sketched out through footage of two trials for the murder of doctors who perform abortions. The narrative built from the opening scene of religious groups protesting in Washington by inefficiently hammering little wooden crosses into the ground. They are fumbling and harmless, if irksome. Tension builds as we watch minister Paul Jennings Hill protest outside the trial of one doctor’s murder. He says to a group of reporters that the convicted murderer’s acts were justified. A reporter jokes, “So will we be seeing you on trial for murder soon?” It’s funny, until 20 minutes later in the film that’s exactly what we are seeing.</p>

<p>The second subject, around which the tension is gradually relieved, is the personal decisions and struggles of women who are seeking abortions. Very early on we see a late 2nd trimester abortion, including the reassembly of the fetus when the doctor makes sure everything is out. And there were so many dead fetuses in this film. As the woman is filmed from the back of her head during the interview and the fetus is, well, filmed from the front, my gut cry of concern went for the fetus in that moment. But then the narrative of violence and pregidous by the religious right escalates. The ending scene follows a woman in her late 20′s who has obviously been through a lot, including the death of an ex-lover, sever physical abuse, and several ended pregnancies. She gets an abortion. It’s such a painful relief. The viewer is emotionally prepped for it this time after the length of the docuemntary. And I was really glad for her.</p>

<p>For the aesthetics, for the documentary strategies, for the history lesson, and for the message, this was amazing.</p>
