  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am currently quelling a fit at my Flash homework. My classes this semester are going pretty well and I am content on the whole. I am still battling burn out from last semester and the summer. This leads to very short patience with my technical homework. I’m just picking an easy target. I had a hard time with the homework last week and the current week’s homework is a reworking of that, so I feel screwed. I need a reference, but the teacher is not teaching out of the book (so the book is of little help) and he is guarding his example files because he does not want us to copy and paste. I don’t understand what I am supposed to go off of, except my notes from class. I guess I need to take better notes. I hate to say this, but I miss bootcamp. Bootcamp was rewarding. Even though my classes are going well enough, I don’t feel very rewarded or accomplishes so far. Hence the excess stress level. (if anyone wants to help me with flash homework, see below)</p>

<p>One thing that did go well is my first assignment for Sounds Design. here it is:  </p>

<p>I have been thinking about how to lower the stress in my lives.  I have my usual excessive course load, and internship, and small freelance jobs. After two years of maintaining schedules like this, I am finally coming around to changing things. While the components might be fun and energizing, this overload is not fun. I want to have fun again. It will be better for all of us if Ida has more fun.</p>

<p>The de-stress plan starts with a trip to the zendo tomorrow morning. I used to go to a zendo quite regularly a few years ago but haven’t of late. Meditating is very challenging, but it isn’t stressful. It’s easy to carry a lot of stress into one’s practice, but I find that sitting gives me a chance to acquaint myself to the din. Know your enemy, know yourself. So tomorrow, nice and early, I’m go to the zendo.</p>

<p>Alright, so, Flash homework help…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create 3 buttons using only action script.<br />
the 1st button should link you to your a.parsons web site, the 2nd button is a movie clip that when press shows something on the trace window and the 3rd just a regular button.</p>

  <p>instead of creating the buttons with regular gaps, like we did in class, i want you to position them at the following coordinates: (30, 45), (113, 100), (305, 267).</p>

  <p>in addition, create a code-generated text field with a specific text<br />
formatting that says something on launch, and make the text and its<br />
formatting change when you click the third button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know I can do this because the code looks just like Processing and I can do things with Processing. The syntax is different enough that I am totally lost without a decent reference. I have till Friday.</p>
