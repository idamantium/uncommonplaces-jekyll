    <p>I took this picture last week of the moon rise on Copacabana.</p>

<p><img src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/07-06-01moon59.jpg" alt="moon rise on copacabana" /></p>

<p>I realized it wasn’t safe to be on the beach at night by myself, even at the early time of 5:45. Part of me feels embarrassed for venturing out like that. There were some people on the beach and it was early and the moon was so pretty! A lot of light from the street was spilling onto the beach and the police were close by. I guess that meant little though. Two girls grabbed me and tried to take my camera, but did not succeed. They only made off with my phone. I hesitate to write this here because I wonder about my parents stumbling upon it. I know they worry a lot and that my mom likes to attribute her insomnia and gray hair to me. I worry that being honest about my experiences will curtail my ability to interact with them. I would rather not sensor myself excessively on my blog because of them though.</p>

<p>The every day violence and poverty here is not like anything I have seen. I guess my previous travels in Guatemala and India left me with a false sense of street smarts. The rules really are different here. Since I’ve been shaken up by that experience, I have been less inclined to go out after dark by myself, even in the neighborhood. I always feel a little like this when I travel. The lone pasty girl so obviously out of here element anywhere but New York City is an easy target. I make a space for myself just fine and enjoy it to a great extent. With time I will figure out the rules here and get reoriented.</p>

<p>After I was jumped, I talked to some friends about it and was very reassured both by the casualness with which they treated the event and their own stories of being robbed. Maybe this sounds odd. I guess it helped to not feel special, to feel like I had a shared experience, and to hear of situations that were much worse, like Harmony’s mom getting robbed her first week in Rio and loosing everything including her passport, or Sergio having cameras stolen aggressively from him on two occasions, once one he had not even finished paying for.</p>

<p>The threat of violence seems to loom in many people minds here in Rio. I have mostly been interacting with privileged people with stable incomes and social networks. They talk about the proximity of the favelas, equating these neighborhoods with violence. I am going to talk generally of what I have heard people saying, rather than recount specific people in specific conversations. I know I might be prone to judge their values and assertions, but that this judgment comes from a very different notion of race, poverty, and urbanization that is probably misguided when projected onto Brazil. Since this is a public blog where I am recounting private conversations, I will remain vague in describing what people tell me. This will give me space to figure how my perceptions and judgments are working while at the same time respecting the gaps between my knowledge and their more intimate and layered knowledge of what is happening in this city, and the circumstances under which they shared that knowledge.</p>

<p>I hear people talk about an inevitable day when the people in the favelas will come down and take over the entire city with violence. This is where the conversation often went when I described being attacked on the beach. One person described the relative safety in São Paulo, where she has moved to from Rio, due to the fact that the slums are relegated to an outer rim of the city. More often than not, the people I talk to qualify their fear as separate from the people living in the favelas. The people in the favelas are not bad, they say. But it seems that the image is of a homogenized incubator of violence in which the other layers of the lives and communities are lost. The ‘not bad’ part of the people living there is fogged over. The society seems very polarized. While I am concerned hearing the sweeping statements about the favela communities and the intense fear of the people living here, the hurdles to picturing the communities differently are great. The alternative voices from the communities and the points of access are stifled under the mixed reality and hype of violence.</p>

<p>One person shared with me a variation on this image that was rooted in misguided city planning and neglect in the 1960′s. In her view, it was the city planner’s fault for not managing the communities better when they gave certain communities the right to the land their houses were on and not just the houses themselves. I remember hearing about this in a <a href="http://newschool.edu/gf/centers/janey/Conf2007.htm">conference</a> that I went to on social democracy and globalization in Latin America. Adriana Abdenur presented a paper called “Three or Four Things You Can Do with a Favela.” She outlined the ways that earnest efforts to improve the conditions in favelas and promote participation in democratic processes during the 1960s were creatively undercut and disempowered. The three things she saw governments doing with favelas were relocate, ignore, or help. This is what the class I am starting a week and a half will get into more. So far, I am getting an idea as to what some people outside these communities think and feel about them, and how they alternately help or ignore them. I had a fun peek at the cultural vibrancy and creative human rights work that is happening in the favelas with <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2007/06/03/by-popular-demand/" target="_blank">my trip</a> to Viver e Crescer. I’m looking forward to seeing more of that.</p>
