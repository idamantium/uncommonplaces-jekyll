    <p>The feijoada at Suzana’s book store was really nice. We rode the subway to Cinelandia and walked to the trolley car station. The wait at the station was quite long and we were worried that we wouldn’t get in. When it finally did arrive, we had to hang on to the sides, which felt pretty nuts, especially going over the arches that stretch over Lapa. There is a fence, but all the fence would do is give you something to tumble over on your way down or push you under the train onto the tracks. The trolley car system dates from the late 19th century when the wealthiest cariocas lives on this hill and rode it to their jobs in the center of the city. The train was packed and quite a number of people were hanging off the sides. It was good fun. Later in the day we watched a trolley go by and side swipe a car, taking off it’s side view mirror! The crowd at the bookstore was chill and we lounged around for a few hours, eating, browsing, and admiring the light.</p>

  In the evening, the capoeira school that is run out of the same building did a performance. Two nights in a row Tricia and I ended up at moving interactive theater events. After a while, I realized it was Romeo and Juliet that they were performing. It was pretty awesome the way they moved all the way around the building, using the various spaces and architecture, with the audience trailing as they went.

  It&#8217;s awfully rainy today, and we need to get dressed up for the visit to the Ford Foundation&#8230;

  To continue with the theme of writing about everything except what happens in class, here are some pictures from the dinner party we threw on Friday night. The whole class was invited, about 8 people showed for dinner and some 6 more showed up later. I was impressed that we accommodated so many, if not terribly comfortably. I enjoyed hanging out with people in a context that was domestic and no one had to play tour guide.
