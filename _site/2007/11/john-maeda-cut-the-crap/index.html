  <article class="post-content">
    <p><a href="http://www.maedastudio.com/index.php">John Maeda</a> spoke at the New School on Wednesday to a full room of star struck Parsons students. The talk was extremely entertaining. His anecdotes about technology, himself, and simplicity were graphic and charming.  I am not sure if the fact that I still don’t know why this man is such a celebrity relates to my own short sightedness or the fact that when everyone seems to know you’re important, you don’t need to explain the significance of what you’re doing anymore.  Maeda’s talk addressed his <a href="http://lawsofsimplicity.com/category/laws?order=ASC">laws of simplicity</a>, but he only managed to cover laws 1-5 and 10.  Seems to me that this is more about feeling simple, rather than being simple.</p>

<p>Okay, qualms aside, what did I get out of this talk:</p>

<p>1)As much as we all decry overworking, the most accomplished people seem to be compulsive workers.  Maeda mentioned that he had been hospitalized twice for overworking.   Meada’s laws of simplicity seem to be as much a personal journey toward sustainability as an intellectual contribution to the design field as a whole.</p>

<p>2) Cute and clever is often enough.  I once had a photo professor insist that all I needed to do was find something in plain sight that no one was seeing ans show it to them.  An effective packaging for this in ‘cute and clever’.  To explain the essence of simplicity, Maeda used a ‘cookies to laundry’ analogy.  Give a kid an option between big cookie and small cookie, they go for big cookie.  Give them the option of folding small laundry pile and big laundry pile, they go for small laundry pile.  Thus, we as people like to minimize discomfort and maximize pleasure.  It’s cute, and makes sense.  Expect for now that i actually take the time to write it out I see look holes, but I didn’t see the loop holes till a few days later.</p>

<p>3) I did get to wondering about the balance between establishment and anti-establishment urges.  Maeda is a man with many many degrees.  He is comfortable and flourishes in academia.  He also  has a bit of an anti-establishment rationality that came out in many examples.  I have always felt like an outsider for my anti-establishment feelings.  Maybe, now that we are all developing an subtle edge of anti-establishment, such that we no longer trust what we are told and we demand the individual product, the reflection of unique fitting/not-fitting, maybe this is really the norm.  We all have the same bug to varying degrees.  Maybe.</p>

<p>4) Meada talked about doing something young while your young.  I asked him what that would be if computers were young when he was young and computers aren’t young anymore.  His first response was ‘figuring out what is crap.’  The idea is that we shouldn’t necessarily focus on learning code.  We should figure out the limits of computers.  He also said that studying up on <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Laurence Lessing</a> might be more important than learning to draw.  The next challenges will be controlling and releasing for control what we make.</p>
