  		  <p>I am going back through my notes and transcribing. Here is where the blog is perhaps more interesting for me than it might be for other readers. Below are my notes from the first session we had at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/" target="_blank">PUC</a>, the private catholic university in Rio. They have an impressive human rights department. Two professors from that department, Marcia Nina Bernardes and Florian Hoffman talked to the class about the concept of citizenship and clientelism in Brazil. Most, if not all, the NGOs we visited talked about and taught citizenship. This concept comes from a post-dictatorship situation where people are negotiating their relationship with the state with the recent memory of being stripped of all rights that usually come with citizenship. Citizenship is such a hot topic because it is not a give in, even under a democracy, because the system is so crippled by clientelist policies, where the law is mailable for some and others need to cater to those people in order to secure rights and privileges.</p>

<p><strong>Brazil class, session 1, Monday June 18th,<br />
Marcia Bernardes / Florian Hoffman – PUC<br />
Historical citizenship in Brazil</strong></p>

<p>Marcia Bernardes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Citizenship* – participation, rights to make individual free and equal<br />
Ceremonial membership of community</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Public Sphere</em> – social stage on which citizenship rights are exercised (traditional sociological theory on Brazil says that public sphere has never existed)</p>

<p>Three main interpretations of Brazilian Social Formation</p>

<p><strong>Sergio Buarque de Holanda</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Raizes do Brazil</li>
  <li><em>Personalism</em>, installation of personalities (charismatic individual as protector)</li>
  <li>“Homen Cordial” emotive, action through heart, feeling<br />
o US -&gt; something is allowed or not allowed<br />
o Brazil -&gt; something is both allowed and not allowed</li>
  <li>Relational system governs social and legal interactions, like a nuclear family, there is a natural hierarchy that you don’t criticize</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Raymond Faoro</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>patrimonial system, prince monopolizes power and bureaucracy rules in prince’s name</li>
  <li>state belongs to someone, not to people</li>
  <li>likened to cast system, no notion of common good</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Roberto DaMatta</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>personalism in terms of persons and individuals, and home vs street</li>
  <li>Person: relational being, kinship, sympathy, interests -&gt; homes setting</li>
  <li>Individual: anonymous no one, not part of relational system -&gt; street setting</li>
  <li>In Brazil, the one higher in the hierarchy will pull rank, “Do you know who you are talking to?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Common diagnosis among analysts</p>
<ul>
  <li>invasion of public realm with logic of private domain</li>
  <li>no clear distinction between private and public, state is property of ruling class</li>
  <li>agricultural system displaced by urbanism -&gt; no new system to deal with new circumstances</li>
  <li>clientelism and nepotism are unavoidable, substitutes political processes and undermines citizenship</li>
</ul>

<p>But Marcia likes the theories of this guy best:<br />
<strong>Nestor Garcia Canclini</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>hybridism</em> -&gt; modernism in Latin America and Brazil, very different from ‘first world’</li>
  <li>both elites and popular classes combine modern and traditional cultures</li>
  <li>relationship between traditional and modern is not substitution</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Three phases of Brazilian Political History</strong> (according to Leonardo Auritzer)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modernaization and Urbanization (1800-1960s)</li>
  <li>Liberalization (1974-1985) -&gt; new democratic actors and development of new repertoire of action (military regime)</li>
  <li>Post-military rule -&gt; new (military) actors still present, but don’t react to decisional sphere<br />
o Creation of public sphere for the first time in Brazilian history -&gt; human rights movement, neighborhood associations, campaigns for direct elections<br />
o What happens in public sphere does not reach the state<br />
o Private pressure still hierarchical, puts pressure on state to maintain clientelism, subverts effects of civil society on laws</li>
</ul>

<p>next speaker:</p>

<p>Florian Hoffman (german guy)</p>

<ul>
  <li>structural fault lines date back to colonial structures, not just lack of interest or egoism</li>
  <li>incredible obstacles to shifting paradigm</li>
  <li>lack of intentionality for end result</li>
</ul>

<p>Greatest human rights issues in Brazil: Police violence and Prison conditions</p>

<p>Much violence is connected to transnational drug trafficking, this violence is deeply connected to political system (political office = immunity). This incorporates 90-95% of crime. Robberies are a front piece of complicated networks. Poor communities are central cites of these systems because of the hybrid system, makes it harder to change and modernize the communities. Opens space for new forms of criminality due to economic activity happening outside state that resists incorporation into the state. (ex: mini buses, not city system, creates space for turf war and thus gang violence)</p>

<p><strong>Three Police forces</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Federal -&gt; college degrees, dismounting corruption schemes, does a decent job, like FBI</li>
  <li>Civil Police</li>
  <li>Military Police -&gt; in street, gray/blue uniform. Main actors of police violence, military like organization, live in barracks, little education, created as instrument of repression in military regime. -&gt; older anti-communist tactics to resist those against military regime are transferred to post-military period, just change ‘communist’ for ‘bandit’ and you see the same military/war logic -&gt; not effort to use policing technique for reincorporating criminals into society. the goal, like in war, is elimination.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Comando Vermelho (mafia like gang) calls the police Comando Azul<br />
o Police military logic cooperates with gang logic, dragging police toward criminality</li>
  <li>police reform is extremely difficult because they have a strong lobby in the government</li>
  <li>poor pay enables a bribery system to develop and the privatization of police duties through hired security forces</li>
  <li>residents of favelas are in a double bind because of criminalization of poverty on state side and exposure to drug cartel violence</li>
</ul>

<p>Militias -&gt; favela residence who used to hold police positions organize themselves to expel gangs. –&gt; problem is it is outside state and resists the methodologization of activities and people involved. Uses war/military mentality, exterminates young people rumored to be involved in gangs. Some successes of these groups only further undermines the legitimacy of police.</p>

<p>What is the relationship between clientelism and corruption? There is a like, blurry, but it does exist.</p>

<p>Epidemic impunity is a legacy of colonial hierarchy.</p>

<p><strong>Innocent person = worker</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Okay to kill criminal because of military/war system -&gt; impossible to convict police of murder because they argue mistaken identity of victim as criminal. Many police homicides are registered as resistance to arrest, so difficult to get accurate numbers.</li>
  <li>innocent people are workers because of a lack of a developed sense of citizenship</li>
  <li>in police jargon, people are either workers or elements/individuals. General warrants don’t specify who to arrest, but rather allow for arrest of ‘suspect elements.’ Any ‘suspect element’ can be arrested.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brazilian sociability</strong> is a result of negotiating clientelist system -&gt; cordiality. You have to be nice to the parking ‘assistant’ because of the implicit threat of violence. Being cordial allows one space to negotiate the clientelist network and manage the violent potential of systems outside the state.</p>

<p>Social elevator vs. Service Elevator issues -&gt; since Brazil wants to be closer to the US and Europe than Africa, they go with the integrated elevator system. No real integration, just a gesture.</p>

<p>Three levels of citizens</p>
<ul>
  <li>those above the law</li>
  <li>those with access to civil rights</li>
  <li>those who are clients of the law</li>
</ul>

<p>“To my friends, everything. To my enemies, the law.”</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Looking back at this talk, I think it was a very solid start to the course. These theme come up over and over again, not just in class but in my daily negotiation of Rio de Janeiro. As much as certain aspect of life in the US follows a clientelist policy, it is totally foreign for me to encounter basic citizenship rights to be functioning on this level. Here, as opposed to other places I have been, the implicit threat tied to the clientelist policy practically flavors the air you breath. I have been thinking a lot about how the violence and threat of crime here feels overwhelming and exhausting. I am trying to figure out why that is. I have a feeling it correlates to the themes discussed here, but I hesitate to jump to conclusions about how exactly. I often feel relieved when I am hanging out with Brazilian friends because the details for interpreting situations remain illegible to me but are second nature to them. Suddenly the friction of walking down the sidewalk or riding a bus smooths over, even if the situation still feels tense and unsafe. When I am on my own, or with other foreigners, I get exhausted and stressed out trying to read a system that remains elusive and where here feels like so much is at stake. Maybe in the other places I have been, namely Guatemala and India, the illegibility of the system didn’t compute to potential violence, so it wasn’t so exhausting. At least in those places, my New York City street sense helped me out. Here, I feel like it is a liability. For the NGOs that we visited, people could negotiate the micro activities that I am having such a hard time with. The challenge was addressing needs on the levels just up from that. How do you secure your home, you place of work, your access to cultural practices, given this precarious and violent system?</p>
