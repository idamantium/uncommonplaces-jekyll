    <p>My return to NYC went smoothly, no plane crashes or rerouted flights. Flying in Brazilian airspace has been a frightening affair of late, what with <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1726359820070718" target="_blank">the crash</a> a few weeks ago of a domestic TAM flight, arriving in São Paulo and failing to slow down on the runway. All passengers and crew died in the resulting inferno. This was just a few months after a similarly devastating crash. Additionally, a friend of mine in the Human Rights and Media class only got as far as the Amazon on his flight, when the radar system went down and they had to return to their point of origin. Ridiculous. The only real nuisance on my flight was a groups of Canadian athletes marching around the plane singing “We got gold, we got gold, oooo” with their metals on.</p>

<p>Getting to my apartment was a nonchalant affair. Even though I’ve been gone for two months, I felt at home immediately and the time away seemed to evaporate. I am missing the weather in Rio, as New York is just muggy and unpleasant at the moment. I found the heat a bit crippling and didn’t accomplish much other than rearrange my room and join the <a href="http://foodcoop.com/" target="_blank">Park Slope Food Coop</a> (finally!).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.martinwildig.com/pictures/emmettbrown_1.jpg" alt="from Martin's Back to the Future Page" align="left" />Today, I continue my summer of pretending I am a graduate student with <a href="http://bootcamp.parsons.edu/2007/" target="_blank">BootCamp</a>, a training program for the Design and Technology department at Parsons. I am switching into the undergraduate program, but to make sure I am caught up with the juniors, I am required to audit this training program for the incoming graduate students. For the next three weeks, I will be in six hours of classes a day, covering Web, Coding, and Visual Design. We just had the intro session and I am stoked. Just the language and philosophy of the department seems like a much better fit for me than the photography department. I really appreciate my two years in Parsons Photography, but it’s time I go a different direction.I will now get to live out my early-teen dreams of being a revolutionary anarcha-feminist hacking superhero. I joked with my history adviser that when I was 13, I was obsessed with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_trilogy" target="_blank">Back to the Future trilogy</a>. It’s awfully appropriate that 10 years later here I am studying History and Design &amp; Technology. Time to start thinking fourth dimensionally. In the words of Doc Brown, “Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need roads.”</p>
