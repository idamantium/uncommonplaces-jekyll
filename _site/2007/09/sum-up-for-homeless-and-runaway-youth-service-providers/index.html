  		  <p>This post is for everyone who made it to my workshop on Media Strategies at the 22nd annual Empire State Coalition conference for homeless and runaway youth service providers the other week. I had a great time giving the workshop and appreciate your interest and input. This is a rundown of some of the topics, tools, and links we went over. Please don’t hesitate to ask me more questions.</p>

<p>Here’s the PDF of the presentation: <a href="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/escpresentation.ppt" title="ESC Media Strategies Presentation">ESC Media Strategies Presentation</a></p>

<p><strong>Media Literacy</strong></p>

<p>Paulo Freire’s Empowerment Spiral is a powerful education framework that has gained popularity among teachers of Media Literacy. A good rundown on Freire is available at the <a href="http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-freir.htm">Informal Education Encyclopedia</a>. I encourage you to familiarize yourself with some of his works, including <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7lgFAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Paulo+Freire&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla%253Aen-US%253Aofficial%26q%3Dpaulo%2Bfreire%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.medialit.org/" target="_blank">The Center for Media Literacy</a> has three well researched guides on theory, practice, and implementation available in PDF format. Most material is broken down by grade level, K-12.</p>

<p>For a more academic overview of the current media landscape, <a href="http://www.bigbrother.net/~mugwump/Postman/" target="_blank">Neil Postman</a> is is good writer to turn to. His work falls under the rubric of Media Ecology.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june02/ewald/" target="_blank">Wendy Ewald</a> pioneered an effective <a href="http://cds.aas.duke.edu/ltp/index.html" target="_blank">Literacy Through Photography</a> system that has gained popularity world wide over the past two decades. It’s easy to hand young people cameras and have a little fun. The more difficult thing is to effectively teach them something in the process and open doors to growth and communication. Ewald’s book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GIY3CjpIYb0C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor:Wendy+inauthor:Ewald&amp;sig=x70ddqwYTEzMYzLp4jCM59QXCrw#PPP1,M1" target="_blank">I Wanna Take Me A Picture</a> talks about how she developed the process of write-photograph-write and different activities she has used within this structure.</p>

<p>**Ethics, Safety and Visual Representation **</p>

<p>We talked about Donna DeCesare’s project photographing youth in Central America effected by gang violence. She used a collaborative method to produce unique images that reflected the children’s stories while still protecting their identities. You can find the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/photography/events/protecting_20070405" target="_blank">audio</a> from a panel discussion with DeCesare and the head photography editor at UNICEF and <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/photography/focus_areas/mw/12#decesare" target="_blank">photographs</a> on the Open Society Institute’s website.</p>

<p>**Media Production **</p>

<p>We focused on web 2.0 technologies as a cheap, accessible, and effective format for you and your organizations to network and get the message out. With the recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14575347" target="_blank">example</a> of the Jena 6 case, the power of grassroots, web-based media can not be underestimated. The Overbrook Foundation put out a report on how these tools are being <a href="http://www.overbrook.org/resources/resources.html" target="_blank">underutilized</a> by human rights organization. So let’s get on top of this…</p>

<p>Web 2.0 refers to the recent shift in the internet toward social media. The consumers of information are now the makers of information. The first step to using these messy but powerful systems is getting organized and find content relevant to your purposes. Bookmarking sites like <a href="http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">Delicious</a> and RSS readers like <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/" target="_blank">Bloglines</a> are good tools with which to familiarize yourself. If you can handle email, these tools will be easy to master. The trick is making them a part of your routine. Once you get the idea, you might want to set up your own blog on <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, or any number of other free services.</p>

<p>Our conversation on social media quickly lead to a questions about clients’ use of site like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>. Organizations servicing homeless and runaway youth have widely divergent positions on allowing clients to access these sites and using them as forums for communication. I hope that these conversations can result in positive shifts in how your organizations see youth engagement with social networking sites. <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/" target="_blank">Danah Boyd</a> has written on youth and social networking. Her articles might be a good jumping off point. Please post comments on resources you use in making policy decision in your organization, as I am researching this topic currently.</p>

<p>**Media Relations **</p>

<p>Most of my information on traditional media realtions was drawn from <em>A Media Relations Handbook for Non-Governmental Organizations</em> by Sara Silverman, The Independent Journalism Foundation, available in PDF form <a href="http://www.media-diversity.org/PDFS/Media%20Relations%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
