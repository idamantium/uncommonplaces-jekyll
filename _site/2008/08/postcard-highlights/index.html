<p>In June and July, I was in India to <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2008/05/25/postcard-booklets-done-leaving-for-darj-in-2-days/">deliver postcards</a> that a Guatemalan coffee cooperative wrote to a Darjeeling tea cooperative. Both communities practice fair trade, organic agriculture and have been heavily involved in local political struggles. Over the past few days, I’ve been organizing and archiving the postcards that the tea farmers <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2008/07/08/postcards-collected-comments-of-distrobution-and-meetings/">wrote in response</a>. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.darjeelingprerna.org/">Darjeeling Ladenla Road Prerna</a> for all the help in organizing the postcard collection, and thanks to all the members of Sanjukta Vikas Sanstha who participated! Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<p>“My name is Lavan Rai. I am a member of SVS. When I read your story, I felt pain and happiness at the same time. You have achieved your independence after a great struggle. Like you cultivate coffee there, we cultivate tea here. We grow other things however, tea is our primary produce which sustains us economically. I believe and hope that someday, some year we will meet.”</p>

<p>“Like you all, we too battled against the government for many years for our rights and many of our brothers gave their lives. Later, though we came to an agreement with the government, we could not get benefits and facilities as expected. Therefore our fight against the government is still on, but this time it is not with arms. The struggle is with pens because today we have a lot of educated people in our society. Hope to meet again through letters. Your friend, Shabanam Chettri<br />

Dear friend, a lot of remembrance to all the friends of Guaemala. I am very happy to know about your place and your organization. It seems your primary produce is coffee and bananas. Similarly, our primary produce is tea leaves. Besides that we also cultivate ginger, tumeric, caridum, oranges, and round chilies. We sell these produce in our local markets. Only tea is being sold in the international market. In this way, DLR Prerna (Darjeeling Ladenla Road Prerna) and TPI (Tea Promoters India) have contributed a great deal in selling the tea in the international market. They have contributed a lot of their time and efforts to our organization. Secondly, fair trade has also helped a lot to our organization. It has provided a great encouragement to the people here to work with more dedication and zeal. A lot of work has been done by the money that came from fair trade. For example, the weighing shed for green tea leaves, repair of roads, SVS office, providing a computer, building small bridges, community hall, etc. All this work became possible by selling our green tea. Therefore we will continue this cultivation in the future with all sincerity. I hope that we will continue to communicate with each other through letters and know about our organizations. Your friend, Binita Rai”</p>

<p>“My regards to all the residents of Guatemala. I was very saddened to read about the painful experiences you have been through. But now better days seem to have come. ‘The fruit of labor is sweet.’ We too are struggling against a lot of problems here but our problems are nothing compared to what you have been through. We humans are never satisfied. How long does it take for the plant in the given picture to bear fruit? Do coffee plants also get attacked by pests? How much does one plant yield in kilograms? To drink coffee at home, is it hand prepared or do you buy a coffee powder? I have several questions like these, all of which cannot be put down here. Therefore I will consider myself fortunate if I can continue writing to you. I bid farewell by wishing you the very best. Thanks. Lhendup Lepcha, SVS, Aabotay, Darjeeling”</p>

<p>“July 6, 2008<br />
Dear friend, Miguelina Gomez Velasquez. Regards. My name is Sujata Chettri, and like you we too have a women’s organization, which is a part of SVS and is known by the name of Sanjukta Nari Sangathan organization. I am a member of this organization. Through this organization we learn how to save money. We attend meetings and workshops. This has benefited us. All we women participate in the undertakings of SVS. Though I wished to write more, I must end here. All of us from the women’s organization wish you the very best. ”</p>

<p><a href="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/svs045b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-570" src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/svs045b1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="168" /></a></p>

<p>“My name is Suresh Chettri. I run a small school here in our village where there are no governmental facilities. Like yours here too lots of small children go through immense hardships to get good education. At present, 40 poor children are seeking education in this school. They are the pillars of our society. My statement to all the small children – study well, listen to your parents, obey your teachers, because you have to get well educated and need to do a lot for your village and country.<br />

Dear sister, even at this tender age, you work so hard. When I saw you working in the picture, I felt like meeting you and sharing our joys and sorrows. Unfortunately, we cannot meet. But I am like your elder brother, therefore, I pray to God for your better future, and best wishes to you and your future. Brother Puran Tamang”</p>
