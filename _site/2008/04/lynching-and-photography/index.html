  		  <p>I am working on a paper about lynching photographs for my History of Slavery in the New World class. I am stretching the scope of the class by reaching into the 20th century so that I can spend time on the more difficult aspects of my favorite medium.</p>

<p>There has been a flurry of scholarship on lynching photographs since the exhibition <a href="http://www.withoutsanctuary.org/">Without Sanctuary</a> at <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/web/">the New York Historical Society</a> in 2000. I remember attending the exhibit and being stuck in a daze as I tried to take in the overwhelming collection of tattered postcards size images of mobs of white people collected around limp, mutilated black bodies. The images are resoundingly about white power. There is no indication of struggle, hysteria, or pain, which must surely figured prominently in the actual event. Masses of white people are gathering around the destroyed black bodies. The photographs are asserting a stable, triumphant, white society that was dying it’s own traumatic death in the midst of these ritualized attempts to assert otherwise. While the white mob lynches the black man, the photograph lynches the mob.</p>

</p>

<p>The need to understand the internal logic and social reality supporting lynching<a href="http://rine.wordpress.com/2008/04/25/i-have-too-many-words/"><img src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/picture-16.png" alt="" width="100" align="left" /></a> is only more evident with the acquittal of the officers responsible for Sean Bell’s murder. Lynching is in many ways so horrific because it was sanctioned by society. Law enforcement did not enforce laws around due process, letting lynchers into prisons to take the accused into their own hands. Judges ruled that the murders were “unknown” when thorough photographic documentation of the events existed. The anxieties and structural inequalities of a slave holding society continue to have violent ramifications that can be traced historical from emancipation up to today.</p>

<p>As I research the topic, I am balancing my moral judgments of the racist practices of a society in flux with the need to probe effectively into circumstances that motivated lynchings, as well as the photographic practices around them. I see some commentators, including the writers of the introduction of the book accompanying the Historical Society’s exhibit, short circuit their analysis by concluding with a moral indictment of lynching. It is easy to point to lynching with disgust and decry the practice. Taking this rout misses the opportunity to understand why these things happened by psychologically distancing the commentator and the reader from the event.</p>

<p>The brutality of the lynching is obvious. To condemn it to some anomaly or deplorable behavior or a throwback to an outdated southern mentality is to close the door to understanding how it was indeed a modern, sophisticated practice particularly relevant to 20th century America. The pervasive use of photography, then a new technology, is one indication among many that lynching was a modern practice. Grace Hale argues in her book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k_ITAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=making+whiteness&amp;dq=making+whiteness&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1"><em>Making Whiteness</em></a> that racial violence is modern because it is the anxious response to modern capitalism where people are equalized as consumers. Race, class, and gender no longer order society as it had before purchasing power was controlled. This argument hold weight when we consider the social climate of other historical moments when lynching was popular, namely the killing of so called witches in Renaissance Europe.</p>

<p>I had a conversation the other day about the roll of photography in shaming. I was talking about human rights and photography, offering examples of projects I was excited about. The person I was talking to brought up Abu Graib and asked about the roll of photography there. He pointed out that all my examples had to do with promoting positive values and that there are many cases where photography can shame in very productive ways. I remain sadly skeptical about the wider impact of the Abu Graib photographs, but I see clearly the need to understand the shaming potential of photography with the following example.</p>

<p>The use of photography to shame requires a careful attention to the situations in which you are injecting the images. Some scholars argue that the advent of photographic practices in newspaper publication actually fueled lynching in the 1890’s. The images were also mailed widely as picture postcards, showing the commodification of such events and the implication of the whole of American society in sanctioning them by passing the evidence through the postal system. This contrasts dramatically to the impact of widely circulated photographs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till">Emmitt Till</a>’s mutilated corpse in 1955. The 14-year-old boy has been kidnapped and brutally killed in Mississippi after having whistled at a white woman on a dare a few days prior. His mother insisted on an open casket funeral. The photographs of the event, including a famous essay in Jet magazine, are credited with <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1969702">giving remarkable impetuous</a> to the then nascent Civil Rights Movement. The moral outrage felt by viewers of the Till photographs motivated them to action, while the moral outrage expressed by commentators looking at lynching photographs 100 years after the fact unconvincingly disassociates them from the implications of the events depicted.</p>

<p>I feel like I just cracked open a few huge topics and now I am not sure how to wrap things up neatly for this post. You’ll have to just wait for my paper to be done.</p>
