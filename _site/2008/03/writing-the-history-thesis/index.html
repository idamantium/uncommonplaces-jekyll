  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am on lock down this weekend to write a draft of my History thesis. I am doing my thesis this semester and will be working on my Design&amp;Technology thesis next year (though the associated paper for this is also due this semester). I did some free writing about the thesis a few weeks ago, which resulted in a coherent and robust structure for the paper, much to my surprise and excitement. I am writing about the <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/bootcamp">postcard correspondence project</a> I am working on between Santa Anita La Union in Guatemala and Sanjukta Vikas Cooperative in Darjeeling, India. The project is a way of looking at historical identity. How do these people conceive of their past, and what do they use those constructions for today? How do those constructions relate to the historical record (however moldy and disorganized, as we see with the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB170/index.htm">police archives recently discovered</a> in Guatemala)? And where do I fit in the process, especially as a member of the fair trade movement?</p>

<p><img src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/historythesis.jpg" alt="historythesis.jpg" /></p>

<p>These papers in the picture are a result of me searching my hard drives for ‘Darjeeling’ and ‘Guatemala,’ and printing the results (minus the photographs, of which there are many thousands). My adviser is adamant about me not doing any more research. Given how much I have worked on this in varying forms in the past, that seems like smart advice.</p>

<p>Here is the concluding paragraph in the free write that I am using for the paper’s structure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am more sympathetic to the communities’ navigation of the hazy lines between history, representation, and identity than I am to the fair trade movement’s navigation of those lines in the name of the communities. Through this sympathy, I began to hope that my photography essays and the dialogue between the communities in the postcards would somehow offer an outsider vision that the communities could use to help locate themselves in the territory of history, representation, and identity. I imagine this process much like triangulation in sailing. When you don’t know where you are, you identify three points in the landscape that are represented on your map. With a compass, you measure your position in relation to those places in north-south degrees. If done flawlessly, a line drawn through the place on the map at the angle measured should also intersect your position. Doing this three times with a natural degree of error results in triangle. You are somewhere in the triangle, and the size of the triangle reflects the accuracy of the measurements. Since my work and I are not a fixed point on any map, pursuing this strategy revealed itself as naively optimistic. I can still construe this as a triangulation process, though in reverse. The three points are Santa Anita La Union, Sanjukta Vikas Cooperative, and me (along with the rest of the first world wing of the fair trade movement). The common point of reference is the postcards, which are the result of a collaborative process between all of us. I can use the postcards as a third anchor point in locating myself in relation to the narratives and perspectives of the two communities. The complexity of this current manifestation of uncovering personal narratives about history might in fact serve my initial motivation to critique and alter the fair trade movement’s representation of the communities much more effectively than my initial solution of a photography essay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am both excited by the prospect of looking into this farther and daunted. This is a good thing. It means there is valuable, challenging work to be done. I will be relying heavily on the concepts in a class I took a year ago called “Memory, Trauma, and Genocide.” This class delved into the relationship between subjects and historians in acute situations of genocide. We read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominick_LaCapra">Dominick LaCapra</a>’s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yA5ms7rnSv0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq">Writing History, Writing Trauma</a>. I devoured this book and found vital distinctions in the way people position themselves in situations of hurt. LaCapra draws out distinctions between absence and loss, acting out, working out, and working through. While most of these concepts are familiar to me through psychology, I was very stimulated to realize the potential of their application to historical analysis. These concepts have become vital to me as I work on issues like genocide, trauma, photography, and activism.  In my final paper for that class, I analyzed <a href="http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/1997/index.html">MOMA’s exhibition of the prison portraits from S21</a>, the detention camp in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge.</p>

<p>This is LaCapra speaking at the <a href="http://www.nssrmemoryconference.com/">Memory Studies conference</a> at The New School in February. The postcard project was exhibited as part of the conference, and <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2008/02/05/postcard-project-on-view-at-new-school/">is still on display</a>.</p>

<p>All right, enough stalling by writing in the blog. Back to work.</p>
