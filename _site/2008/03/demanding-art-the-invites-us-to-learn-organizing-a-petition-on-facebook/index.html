  		  <p>Last week, I helped get a petition together at school. The petition is requesting that murals that <a href="http://newschool.edu/">The New School University</a> recently installed in the new Parsons lobby be removed and that new murals be put up with the input of students. The petition was drafted collaboratively on <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. I think the development of the complaints about the murals and the petition is pretty interesting. It illustrates how organizing can happen in cyberspace, and how the cyberspaces interface with face-to-face interactions and meetings.</p>

<p>The new lobby at 2 W 13th street had been under construction for well over a semester. They unveiled it early in February, with much of the artwork yet to be installed. The wall space around the two elevators was white at that time. It was papered over with murals, one of a distraught white women getting out of a car, the other of pixilated comic strips. Students started grumbling immediately. The image of the distraught women was like a big billboard facing out onto 5th avenue. It is oppressive to stand under as you wait for the elevator. I avoid it, and other students, especially women, have said they avoid those elevators too. The other work is just not fit to be enlarged and fragmented the way it is other the other elevator bank. On top of all this, the print quality is very poor and both installations have started to peal already.</p>

<p>Two students came to the Parsons Student Senate meeting on Wednesday, March 5th to complain. I was pretty excited to see this. Some academic advisers had been pushing students to organize around this. I was reluctant to take the task on just because I was up to so many other things, and I wasn’t sure how good the response to taking action would be. New School students are notoriously difficult to organize. The two students who came to the meeting articulated their complains, and I took them down in the meeting minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MFA DT students came to the meeting specifically to voice concerns about the mural around the elevators at 2 W 13th street. Many present at the meeting echoed their concerns and expressed hearing consistent negative feedback form other students as well.</p>

  <p>Concerns included</p>
  <ul>
    <li>feels like your walking through a billboard</li>
    <li>not representative of student body</li>
    <li>language of retail and commerce, not learning</li>
    <li>previously welcoming space now unwelcoming, emotionally unsettling</li>
    <li>some students make a point to avoid that entrance</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The next morning, I was on facebook and noticed that someone had written on a friend’s wall, saying they had missed her at some meeting. The wall post ended with a sarcastic comment asking is the “big-ass fugly girl above the elevator scare you away?” This motivated me to write a note about complaints against the mural coming up at the Parsons Student Senate meeting. What I didn’t realize at the time was the wall post was referencing a facebook group started by one of the students who came to the senate meeting. The title of the group was called something along the lines “What’s with the big-ass fugly girl above the elevator?”</p>

<p><img src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/08-03-23petition.jpg" alt="facebook editing" align="right" />So, I start a facebook note. In the course of the conversation about the note, Alex Cline suggested that someone speak about the murals at the rally the following week. Alex was helping organize the rally calling for more transparency at the university. The rally was scheduled for the following Wednesday. I wrote back that it would be great if someone spoke, and that we needed some sort of concrete action to follow up on the speach. The most obvious thing to me was a petition. Subalekha Udayasankar, one of the students who initially complained at the Parsons Student Senate meeting, volunteered to speak. Now that several people were involved, I took on the task of petition writing.</p>

<p>I wanted input on the petition, but when I ask people for help, most responded that they were too busy. All us overworked design school students… I certainly didn’t feel comfortable writing the petition alone. I finally just edited the Parsons Student Senate meeting minutes into a petition like format and posted another note on facebook asking for suggestions. This was on Tuesday, March 11th, the day before the rally. Through that day and into the night, a number of students, including ones who had otherwise said they were too busy to work on it, offered their feedback. To the right, you’ll see a the screenshot of the thread. About 30 hours after I posted the initial note, we had come up with petition text that resulted from an open and collaborative process. I laid it out, printed up copies, and got to the rally to support Subalekha as she spoke.</p>

<p>Here’s the text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Petition for the removal of the<br />
2 W 13th street lobby murals</p>

  <p>We the students of Parsons and The New School at large are petitioning to remove the murals in the new lobby at 2 W 13th Street. The murals communicate in the language of commerce and branding that is inappropriate in an academic institution and inconsiderate of students who use the space daily. Walking into the elevators feels like walking through a billboard.</p>

  <p>The mural around the east elevator bank of a solitary, distraught white woman is emotionally abrasive and communicates disempowerment on a number of levels. Students have reported conscientiously avoiding those elevators as a result. The mural on the west elevator bank is offensively unsuccessful and embarrassing to a design school of such prestige. We feel that neither piece would likely pass any formal critique in this school, nor are they at all appropriate for large-scale installation.</p>

  <p>We are asking The New School to address our concerns by removing the murals. Further, we feel that these issues would have been addressed if students had been included in the selection process. As these and other profound changes occur to the built environment of our education, we ask for a system where there is more transparency and more student inclusion. We are some of the best and brightest minds entering the design industry: we want our skilled input to be included in the decision-making process of the design of our school. We want art that speaks to the sophistication and aptitude of the student body.</p>

  <p>We want art that invites us to learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original facebook group against the mural was deleted because the snarky title resulted in people just ridiculing the thing rather than organizing on how to change it. The new facebook group on the issue, called “Students against 2 W 13th lobby murals” currently has 86 members. Academic advisers and faculty have told me that the activity on facebook has caught the administration’s attention. There hasn’t been too much activity around it since the rally because of we’re on spring break. Hopefully we can get the petition moving and have a good number of signatures over the next few weeks. Several students have expressed ideas for alternative uses for the wall space and systems of student input on the administration and curation of the space. I’m looking forward to hashing out these ideas and getting some art on the walls that inspires us learn.  At least the current art has inspired us to take action.</p>
