  		  <p>Last week as my history adviser <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=1758">Paul Ross</a> gave me a recommendation letter, he took the opportunity to say that when I am out in the world doing various impressive things, I better not simply say I studied at Parsons.  Indeed, I am often guilty of not standing up for the excellent education I’ve received from the history department at Eugene Lang and thus dissing all my history professors in the process.</p>

<p>In addition to studying History at <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/">Eugene Lang</a>, I am studying Design and Technology at <a href="http://www.parsons.newschool.edu/">Parsons</a>, both schools being part of <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/">The New School University</a>.  Come May, I will finish my undergraduate career with a Bachelors of Arts and a Bachelors of Fine Arts.  There have been many occasions where I simply state that I am studying at Parsons or that I am studying at The New School.  This is out of laziness or passive deception.  Parsons usually strikes a cord with people (for good or bad), and they can place me without further explanation on my part.  The New School has a solid reputation among historians, anthropologists, and media theorists.  I say that I am studying at The New School to identify with this reputation and to allow them to continue assuming that I am a graduate student. After talking to me for 5 minutes or hearing about what I am working on, most academics and professionals assume that I am working on a PhD.  About half the time, upon realizing that this assumption is inaccurate, they write me off.  By sheepishly responding to this elitism by obscuring my undergrad education, I’m denying my professors at Eugene Lang the credit they deserve.</p>

<p>The value of my education at Parsons is almost entirely dependent upon the conceptual frameworks and analytical skills that I have been taught at Eugene Lang.  BAFA students, as us dual degree candidates are call, are respected at Parsons for this and highly valued for our contributions to the studio practice.  That said, being at both institutions expose unsettling paradoxes. For example: being asking in one class to produce “photographs of diverse crowds in anonymous locations” to illustrate a report on a project in New Orleans while at the same time learning in another class about the problematic implications of visuals tropes around anonymity and masses in England’s anti-slavery movement.  These paradoxes have made my undergraduate education extremely challenging.  I’m glad to encounter these challenges now because I’ll be better off in the work place because of it.  My history professors are consistently interested in the contradictions my education posses and offer me exciting opportunities to engage those contradictions.  Their support has enabled me to make something of my education in design at Parsons.  Thanks Paul for taking me to task on that.</p>
