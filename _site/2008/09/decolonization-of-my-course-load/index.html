  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Everyone concerned with my workaholic tendencies will be relieved to hear that I have dropped two <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2008/09/03/hit-the-ground-running-semester-starts/">classes</a>.  On the elevator after video class, my friend Roland and I commiserated over the fact that we are stoked about the content of all our courses, but not looking forward to the superhuman workload. “Yea, I can feel it in my body. It’s resisting,” he said. I had been feeling the same way, and it was already leading to some insomnia.  Pretty much all of my elevator conversations at school touch on either the deplorable traffic patterns of the elevators (more on that soon) or bemoan the workload.  After talking to Roland, I got online, combed through my transcript and counted out my credits.  I have enough that don’t need to take the usually high number of credits for dual degree students to graduate on time.  Sadly, but with a sigh of relief I dropped my databases and Portuguese classes.  I have slept much better since.</p>

<p>The administrators I have been talking to are just as irritated as the students about the workload and the bureaucracy.  Parsons was recently restructured into sub-colleges.  Officially, this will give students greater access to classes outside their department and streamline advising. (Is advising something to streamline?)  Really, this means another layer of bureaucracy that is eating into the time of key faculty members and advisers, including many people I depend on to navigate this academic jungle.  I am becoming aware of the extent to which the culture at Parsons can exacerbate some of my own weaknesses.  It feels good to step outside this dynamic a little by taking fewer classes.</p>

<p>With my new found free time, I made it to a fascinating talk by Eyal Weizman  titled <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/NSSR/pastEvents.aspx?id=24306&amp;DeptFilter=NSSR+Historical+Studies">“The Future Archaeology of Israel’s Occupation.”</a> He talked about the dynamic push-pull around the key politicized geographic feature in Israel, hilltops, and the key architectural feature, the wall.  He saw these sites of tension as opportunities for creative intervention.  He also identified the single-family home as a basic unit of the colonial configuration.  Of the many questions he posed, I found three particularly compelling: What is the fate of colonial architecture in the wake of decolonization? How do you inhabit the house of one’s enemy? What do you do with the single-family house?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/Pictures/468xAny/j/c/y/Hollow_Land_ready.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="israel houses" src="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/Pictures/468xAny/j/c/y/Hollow_Land_ready.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="346" /></a><br />
I could go on about how this relates to the concept of the cybernetic organism (read ‘cyborg’) in cold war imaginations, or the practice of the Argentine dictatorship to adopt the children of the people they disappeared.  This all will have to wait for another blog entry.</p>
