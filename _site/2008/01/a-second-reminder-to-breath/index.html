  		  <p>I’ve had a few blows to my self-esteem and grounding over the past week. I’ve also experienced quite a number of successes and great gains. It’s been a struggle balancing the two sides, and right now the down side is weighing in heavier.</p>

<p><img src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/hurtingtight.jpg" alt="hurting" width="500" /></p>

<p>I have a great deal of free time at the moment because it’s the break between semesters and my travel plans fell through at the last minute. With this free time and the rocky emotions, I’m re-centering through meditation, exercising at capoeira classes and on bike rides, cleaning house literally by completely rearranging and reorganizing my apartment, and spending time with friends that I neglect when I am overrun with school work. (I’ve only made so much progress with my <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2007/12/20/breath-its-break-time/">reading list</a>.)  All of this has been uplifting. I think meditation is the key piece. When I keep up with a daily practice, I am attuned. The mental chatter quiets down and undercurrents are more accessible. I follow my intuition. Intuition takes you to the places you need to go. Some of these places have been near agonizing recently. I take it as an indication that I am in transition, moving from one place to another. Old wounds get opened, retreated, and heal over a little better. It’s the perfect time for it to happen as I have the energy to attend to them. I go through this periodically and I’m always better for it.</p>

<p>“You know there’s the low tide moment when the water doesn’t even seem to be moving, we need to breath like that.”</p>
