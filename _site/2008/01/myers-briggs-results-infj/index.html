<p>I have had more than a few people speculate what my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers-Briggs personality type</a> is. I finally took a <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">test</a> today (actually, I took <a href="http://similarminds.com/jung.html">two</a> to make sure). Looks like I am an INFJ (Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging). This means I’m the same type as Gandhi, Carl Jung, and Yoda. I can live with that. I started cracking up upon reading one description of this type when it listed “attracted to sad things.” This is so much the case that an ex of mine made a running joke after I picked out a documentary on genocide for one of our early dates.</p>

  It seems I get along especially well with ENFPs (Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving). The friend who asked me to take the test, and the one I just asked to take the test, are both this type.

  Here&#8217;s a summary from <a href="http://typelogic.com/">Typelogic.com</a>:
</div>

<div align="left">
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div align="left">
  Beneath the quiet exterior, INFJs hold deep convictions about the weightier matters of life. Those who are activists &#8212; INFJs gravitate toward such a role &#8212; are there for the cause, not for personal glory or political power.INFJs are champions of the oppressed and downtrodden. They often are found in the wake of an emergency, rescuing those who are in acute distress. INFJs may fantasize about getting revenge on those who victimize the defenseless. The concept of &#8216;poetic justice&#8217; is appealing to the INFJ. &#8220;There&#8217;s something rotten in Denmark.&#8221; Accurately suspicious about others&#8217; motives, INFJs are not easily led. These are the people that you can rarely fool any of the time. Though affable and sympathetic to most, INFJs are selective about their friends. Such a friendship is a symbiotic bond that transcends mere words.INFJs have a knack for fluency in language and facility in communication. In addition, nonverbal sensitivity enables the INFJ to know and be known by others intimately.

<p>Seems pretty accurate to me. What type are you?</p>
