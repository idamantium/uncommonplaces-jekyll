<p>Six of our team members gave a thorough and convincing presentation to the panel of judges in New Orleans last week for the Chase Urban Design competition. The New School entered the design competition with a project developed jointly between Milano, the urban policy and management school, and Parsons, the design school. Our design for a 140-unit mixed-income residential complex in conjunction with Volunteers of America is exciting in three aspects. All these aspects are related to the adjacency to the riverfront vision, which will be adding parks and developments to the New Orleans riverfront in the coming years.</p>

<p><a href="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/picture-16.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413" src="http://idaimages.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/picture-16.png" alt="" width="240" align="right" /></a>First, the structure is mid-rise, setting a precedent for future development by respecting the existing scale of adjacent neighborhoods while increasing density. Second, the high proportion of low-income units makes this soon to be highly desirable areas accessible to those most needing housing in New Orleans. Third, the plan for retail space and services makes use of the access point to the parks through a break in the floodwall, turning a neglected cobblestone street into a site of vibrant community activity.<br />

<p>Why did we get 2nd place? The competition stipulated that preference would be given to projects in the 17 post-Katrina recovery zones. We knew this when we chose our site, which is not in one of the recovery zones. Given our options of sites with Volunteers of America, we chose 1770 Tchoupitoulas for its challenges both in terms of financing and design. The value of what was learned in developing the project far outweighed the value of following the rules to win first place.</p>

<p>Working on this project, I had the opportunity to consider different ways that groups work together (or don’t work together) as they collaborate toward a final goal. The graphic designers, the architects, and the finance experts all offered vital components to the project through different working and collaboration styles. I was asked to help coordinate the groups, going to different meetings, briefing everyone on what was happening, bridging gaps, and get information to where it needed to be. I am good at this, which is the same reason why I am encourage to be involved in student government(s). It has been good to remember this strength since I have few oppertunities to use it in my time at school before this semester. Even better to come out of the experience as part of a winning team with an innovative project to contribute to the future of New Orleans. I also learned about the intricacies of working with a client. In this case,Volunteers of America’s community outreach plan did not match the time line of the competition. What began as a frustrating limitation opened up new understandings. The outreach work that the Milano team did given certain constraints went far beyond the expectations of Volunteers of America and has made their work easier as they move ahead to develop the site. The requirements of the client taught us about the nature of community work in New Orleans and the determination of the team to develop a winning project opened up unexpected doors for the client. What was initially experienced as conflict resulted in synergy.</p>
