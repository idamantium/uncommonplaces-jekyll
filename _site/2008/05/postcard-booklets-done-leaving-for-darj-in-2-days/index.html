  <article class="post-content">
    <p>My summer plans are very exciting. I leave for India in two days. I will be in Darjeeling for about eight weeks to work on <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/bootcamp/">the postcard project</a>. Then I will be in Ethiopia for two weeks visiting <a href="http://www.suddenflowers.org/">Sudden Flowers Productions</a>, a video arts collective of HIV/AIDS orphans. For the final weeks of the summer, I will be in Rio de Janeiro to visit my friend Tricia Perry as she works on a Fulbright project creating educational multimedia on HIV/AIDS stigmatization. I get back to New York City on September 1st.</p>

<p>In India, I will be delivering the postcards that the Guatemalan coffee farmers wrote to the Indian tea farmers and collecting responses. The month has been nonstop efforts to get this together. I am delivering the postcards as booklets with the front and back of each postcard and the translation of the Spanish message into Nepali.</p>

<p>We were very close to getting <a href="http://uncommonplaces.com/2008/03/04/dear-devanagri-and-adobe-please-make-nice/">the fonts problem</a> fix, but didn’t quite get there. Nepali is written in Devanagari, the same alphabet as Hindi. There are two kinds of fonts, Unicode and TrueType. Coordinating what kind of font the translation was in and how to make that work on the apple computers we were doing layout on was a total headache. In the end, half the translation was in a usable font and half was all garbled. We just went with copying and pasting from a PDF, which worked just fine despite giving us fewer layout options. <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~mminassian/">Maral Minassian</a> worked on the layout, putting in all-nighters in the middle of finals. I am very happy with the design, as is she. Thanks so much, Maral.</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.micropage.com/">MicroPage</a> for the printing. The staff at MicroPage were consistently generous and responsive. I thoroughly enjoyed working with them. They started joking that I had a time sheet in back because I was there so often to address problems and provide updated materials. The Parsons Student Senate and the Lang Student Union at The New School funded the printing.</p>

<p>The 450 booklets were finished on Friday. I packaged them up and FedExed about 350 of them to Darjeeling. I will be carrying about 50, and leaving 50 in New York. Thank you to the Communication, Design and Technology department for funding the shipping. I will give a presentation on the project to the incoming graduate Design and Technology students in early September. I showed <a href="http://spotlight.macfound.org/main/entry/colleen_macklin_petlab_prototyping_play/">Colleen Macklin</a>, the department chair, the final booklet. She is familiar with the project from my presentations through the <a href="http://indiachina.newschool.edu/">India China Institute</a>. Her take is that I am doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">interaction design</a>, just not in the computer. This interpretation opens up doors for applying the content and spirit of the project to a variety of media formats.</p>

<p>My history advisor <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=1758">Paul Ross</a> saw the final booklets and congratulated me on successfully subverting the colonial history of the postcard. This kind of accomplishment makes me raise my fist in the air and holler a triumphant, Yea!!! I wrote my history thesis on the historical identity of the two communities, including how Santa Anita, the Guatemalan community, talks about themselves in the postcards. The thesis still needs a major revision that was simply not feasible in the time span of the semester. It’s also missing important things like thorough footnotes… That said, it is an articulate document, and perfection is procrastination. So, <a href="http://a.parsons.edu/~ibenedetto/misc/IdaBenedettoHistoryThesis.pdf">here you go (34 page PDF)</a>. Any comments and suggestions are welcome. Keep in mind it is a work in progress. This is an interesting difference between the social sciences and design practices. In design, it’s quite acceptable to publish your iterations, while in the social sciences, drafts aren’t accepted as publishable documentation of a process. ~shrug~ As always, I’m glad be obnoxiously interdisciplinary.</p>
