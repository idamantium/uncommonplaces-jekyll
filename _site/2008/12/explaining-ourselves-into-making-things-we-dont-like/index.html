  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Anyone who has talked to me in the past few months has been subjected to my moaning complaints about the <a href="http://www.parsons.edu/">Parsons</a> thesis process.  Listening this morning to the <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/">Radio Lab</a> episode on <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/11/14/segments/113310">Choice</a>, I burst into laughter at <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/index.html">Malcom Gladwell</a>’s anecdote on how explaining yourself invariably results in choosing unsophisticated things.  I have repeatedly run myself into philosophical and aesthetic dead ends in thesis for over explaining myself, an act which repeated presentation of work to piers and teachers during the five hours of class time each week actively encourages.  Yes, five hours of class time a week for thesis.  I deeply regret being so judicious about attending class and taking my rigorously logical and insightful professor all too seriously.  Even more so, I regret being outspoken myself and making class time more challenging for my piers.</p>

<p>In Gladwell’s <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/11/14/segments/113310">example</a> on Radio Lab, he references an experiment by psychologists <a href="http://tim.wilson.socialpsychology.org/">Tim Wilson</a> and <a href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/schooler/index.php">Jonathan Schooler</a> where students are offered free posters.  They can choose between a cute kitten image or an impressionist painting.  The group that had to explain their choice overwhelmingly chose the kitten posters, largely hating the posters six months later according to follow up phone calls.  The group that did not need to explain themselves overwhelmingly chose the impressionist posters and continued to enjoy them.</p>

<p>Amid the clamor over what thesis should do for us Parsons students, be that land us a job, get us public recognition, serve as centerpiece in out portfolios, and so forth, I find that as the process wears on, what I most deeply want is to like what I make.  Isn’t that a tall enough order, to live up to my own standards?</p>

<p>__</p>

<p><em>Addendum: As I read up on the <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/117671">Studs Terkel</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/books/08terkel.html">memorial</a> I missed yesterday, I am compelled to add the caveat here that I find much of Gladwell’s work charmingly reductive.  He is a phenomenal storyteller, my own relish in relating to his anecdote a clear sign of this.  Studs Terkel, though, turns us all into good storytellers.</em></p>
