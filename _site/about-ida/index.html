		<article class="post-content">
    <p>For the past 10 years, I have been provoking new insight through adventure and play.</p>

<p>I thrive on expanding people’s horizons through first-hand experience and broadening our ability to empathically imagine the experience of others. This is fueled by my own innate appetite for exploration and coloring outside the lines. My work has taken the form of games, adventures, documentary media, and educational endeavors. At their best, my projects break new ground for understanding, connection, and collaboration across differences big and small.</p>

<p>I am also passionate about helping unconventional creative communities flex their muscles. I’m often at the helm of a fair bit of creative chaos, be it with a film collective of AIDS orphans in Ethiopia or a punk rock video game arcade gallery in Brooklyn. I accentuate the groups’ potential for the sake of greater impact and stability.</p>

<h3 class="subheader">Currently</h3>

<p>As a Senior Designer at <a href="https://www.sypartners.com/" target="_blank">SYPartners</a>, I create systems of human-led, purpose-driven transformation at the individual, organizational, and societal level to propagate large-scale, positive impact.</p>

<p>Independently, I’m exploring the design of <a href="/2016/04/sex-death-survival/">transformative social experiences</a> by comparing sex parties, funerals, and wilderness trips. The research started through graduate work at the School of Visual Arts’ <a href="http://designresearch.sva.edu/program/" target="_blank">Design Research Program</a> and is now supported through a research residency at <a href="http://www.newinc.org/" target="_blank">NEW INC</a>.</p>

<p>I advise documentary and educational organizations, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://theheartradio.org/" target="_blank">The Heart Radio</a>, a podcast about love and intimacy on the Radiotopia network</li>
  <li><a href="http://magnumfoundation.org/photoex/" target="_blank">Photography, Expanded</a>, an initiative of the Magnum Foundation to inspire documentary photographers to extend their storytelling practice beyond the still image</li>
  <li><a title="School For Poetic Computation" href="http://sfpc.io/" target="_blank">The School for Poetic Computation</a>, an artist-run school about the intersection of code, design, hardware, and theory</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subheader">Formerly</h3>

<p>I co­-founded two design practices: <a href="http://sextant.works">Sextantworks</a>, which orchestrated adventures in places you aren’t supposed to be, and <a href="http://playistheantidote.com/">Antidote Games</a>, which creates playful experiences for understanding complex realities.</p>

<p><a href="http://sextant.works">Sextantworks</a> functioned like a mix between a design studio and a Burning Man camp, creating dozens of site-specific adventures in New York City and abroad over the course of nearly four years. I organized the inspired exploits of intrepid underground creatives into a design methodology that drilled into the historic nature of unloved and overlooked places. We transformed people’s sense of risk and possibility in the built environment. Our exploits garnered a fair bit of attention in the press, attracting high-end, private commissions, among other client work.</p>

<p><a href="http://playistheantidote.com/">Antidote Games</a> caters to humanitarian organizations and NGOs like the International Federation of the Red Cross, the African Climate Change Resilience Network, and the Innocence Project, making games that convey unfamiliar realities so players can understand why people make the decisions that they do. I worked with Antidote for the first two years of its existence, leading client relations and establishing the design workflow.</p>

<p>Before founding Antidote and Sextantworks, I traveled compulsively doing documentary projects and collaborative media production in Guatemala, India, and Brazil, and pursued a Fulbright-funded project in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>As for education, I have an M.A. in Design Research from the School of Visual Arts, a B.F.A. in Design &amp; Technology from Parsons, and a B.A. in History from The New School University.</p>

<p>Of all my accomplishments, few will top being voted “Most Likely to Discover Time Travel” by my junior high classmates.</p>
