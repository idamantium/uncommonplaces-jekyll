  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Last night, I attended <a href="http://www.92y.org/shop/event_detail.asp?productid=T-MM5FF06">Dancing with Dionysius: Narrative and Video Games,</a> a talk by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Fortugno">Nick Fortugno</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.92y.org/shop/category.asp?category=88892TRI+92YTribeca+State+Of+Games888">Byte Me: Inside Digital Gaming</a> speaker series at the 92st Y Tribeca hosted by Sam **Strick.  Fortugno is the Co-Founder and CCO of Rebel Monkey.  I’m currently taking his Narrative and Dynamic Systems class at Parsons and enjoyed hearing him talk out side of class about a topic he is most passionately invested in.</p>

<p>He began his talk on the power of narrative in video games by outlining a debate that happened after Robert Ebert <a href="http://blogs.setonhill.edu/DennisJerz/EL250/013631.php">pronounced</a> that video games are not art. When the game community, including <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14478">Clive Barker</a>, refuted Ebert’s assessment, the film critic defended his position; “Video games by their nature require player choices, which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature, which requires authorial control.”</p>

<p>So, the agency of the viewer undoes dramatic necessity, thus negating the form as art? The argument is weak, and reveals an important double standard that governs popular imaginaries about video games.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mousechief.com/dhsg/index.html">Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble</a> is an acclaimed RPG that was <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/02/18/dangerous-high-school-girls-in-trouble-in-trouble/">pulled from</a> the <a href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/">Big Fish</a> site. Why? <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/89570-Dangerous-High-School-Girls-Pulled-For-Rape-Scene">Paul Thelan</a> of Big Fish said that a branch of the story contained a rape scene. The game’s lead designer, Keith Nemitz, said that scene in the game was not a branch of the narrative, but rather a major plot element, and that this scene is on par with a PG film. Why not judge games by the same standards as movies?</p>

<p>If we put Ebert and Thelan’s arguments about games together, we end up with an unfortunate paradox; games are seen as both incapable of and too dangerous to allow for emotional content.</p>

<p>Here, Fortugno took us on a fast paced recap of video game history. It seems that video games can even be compared to films because many of them are narrative, that is they are structured around stories. Early video games evoked stories to make sense of themselves, but it wasn’t until interactive fiction that the narrative became part of the game experience. Now, narrative in games ranges from highly cinematic sequences to engrossing interactive play.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect">Mass Effect</a>, like Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble, met with criticism for containing apparently explicit content. Watch out for the “full digital nudity,” as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0kdm7fg804">Fox News put it</a>. The game designers <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/games/2008/01/ea_calls_fox_out_on_insulting_mass_effect_inaccuracies-2.html">defended</a> the game as showing nothing more than what was common on prime time television.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.columbinegame.com/">Super Columbine Massacre </a>is another game that was judged by different standards than films of similar content. Creator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ledonne" title="Danny Ledonne">Danny Ledonne</a> refused to take the game off the internet, asserting that it was his artistic response to the shootings. Ian Bogost <a href="http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000551.shtml">commented</a> that Super Columbine Massacre is conceptually difficult, and we need more video games like that. The game was <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/top/slamdance-columbine-pulled-on-moral-grounds-226556.php">removed</a> from <a href="http://www.slamdance.com/">Slamdance</a> by the festival president after the organizers of the game competition solicited the game for a competition.</p>

<p>Why the difference between what is tolerated from films and what is tolerated games? Fortugno turned to Nietzsche’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy">The Birth of Tragedy</a> for the answer. Nietzsche identifies Apollonian aesthetics, where perfect order and beauty are studied from a removed vantage point, and Dionysian aesthetics, where ecstatic experience is created through participation and loss of boundaries.  As an example,  Fortugno had the audience compare and contrast watching a ballet performance to dancing drunk.  The Dionysian experience is often seen as a threat. The mob always ruins the perfection. (I see important parallels here with a fear of the masses that developed during 19th century chapters in the creation of nation states, contemporary with Nietzsche’s writings.  Even today, what Dionysian experiences are not met with some moral scrutiny, aside from religious activity that is?)  There is something powerful about the Dionysian that Nietzsche and Fortugno relish.  The aesthetic experience of viewing (watching a film) is fundamentally different from doing (playing a game) and cannot be judged by the same standards. Fortugno asserts that video games are different from movies in the method they employ, not content they permitted.</p>

<p>I asked Fortugno to elaborate on the connection between art and narrative. He said that games are always rituals, in the Dionysian sense of engaging in an experience. We have had games since before human existence. Animals play games where they engage with a set of rules that create the possibility for loss of boundaries (immersive experience). Games changed in the 1970’s when narrative was added. This addition broadened the emotional range of game play from what can be experienced in, say, chess to what one now gets from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_out_3">Fall Out 3</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_(video_game)">Indigo Prophecy</a>, and others. I take this to mean that since video games exhibit the potential to invoke the full range of human emotions, they are art, even if the form has not reached its zenith.</p>

<p>“Pursuing dangerous content is dangerous, and that’s what art is about.” – Nick Fortugno</p>
