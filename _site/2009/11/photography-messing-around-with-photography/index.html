  <article class="post-content">
    <p>There were a lot of cameras out on Saturday at the <a href="http://blog.idaimages.com/2009/11/16/hfcs-9th-anniversary-celebration/">9<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration</a> for Hope for Children.  The custom used to be that conscientious foreigners visiting developing countries would give prints to locals in exchange for posing for pictures.</p>

<div class="full-image">
  <img src="/images//2009/11/dyptich.jpg" alt="" width="596" />
</div>

<p>Here, the dynamic has changed.  The instant gratification of seeing the image on the back of the camera increasingly takes the place of giving back prints.  Is this a bait and switch, where the mystique of the foreigner’s technology leads to the locals missing out on a fair exchange, or is a different kind of interaction happening all together?</p>

<p>The flow of images between the developing world and the developed world has always been a two-way street, but the producers of highly circulated images have consistently come from privileged backgrounds.  Researchers, artists, and journalists make images about far-flung and exotified places for the enrichment of those in developed counties while mass media designed for the same audiences filters out across the globe and deeply influences the media culture of developing countries. The flow of visual media came under intense scrutiny in the 1960s and 1970s when post-colonial anxiety reached a fever pitch.  This anxiety was perhaps best captured by Susan Sontag in her book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Photography">On Photography</a>, where she associated the proliferation of photographic imagery with chronic voyeurism antagonistic of any meaningful intervention.[1. Thankful Sontag revised this view with a more nuanced stance toward visual representation in her last book, <a href="http://contemporarylit.about.com/od/thearts/fr/regardingPain.htm">Regarding the Pain of Others</a>.] In response, a host of community oriented creative practices took hold, including the practice of conscientious travelers giving prints to those in the photographs. Giving people prints focuses on exchange.  The foreigner gets the image they want and the local gets a copy for cooperating.  Now, in many places I travel to, locals are quick to insist upon prints and will speak with vivid indignation about those visitors who promised prints but didn’t deliver.</p>

<p>The dynamic around photography at the Hope for Children anniversary celebration was wholly different.   This was in part because these locals are kids accustomed to interacting with foreigners who support Hope for Children’s work.  Many of the kids are uninhibited about engaging these strangers, and they have expectations around digital photography that seem to have as much to do with participation as exchange.</p>

<p>Not only were kids asking to have there picture taken and immediately reaching to turn the camera around to see the results.  Many were asking to take the pictures themselves, often with no apparent expectation of keeping their work.  I wonder if there is something decidedly ‘new media’ about their interests to get their hands on the technology and participate in production.  The dynamic I witnessed felt a lot like kids jumping at the opportunity to ‘mess around’ with visual media and digital technology, an important learning activity for digital youth identified in <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/11/20/digital-youth-projec.html">a recent report by UC Berkeley ‘s iSchool</a>.</p>

<p>While I was at the celebration principally as a photographer, to make images, one interaction left me with something decidedly more valuable that a photograph.</p>

<p>The sun on Saturday was strong, like it is most days this close to the equator.  I spent some time hugging the thin lip of shade cast by a corrugated tin fence.  After a while, I felt a tug on my pants and looked down to see a girl of about 7 years old pointing timidly at my camera and then at herself.  She wanted me to take her picture. My first reaction was a feeling of nausea as her eager eyes and covered head brought to mind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl_%28photo%29">Steve McCurry’s iconic image</a> and all the dubious cultural and gender baggage that fueled its’ popularity.  Judging by her expression, it took her a while to find the nerve to get my attention.  She must have seen the more assertive kids getting in on the photography action and wanted to participate.  I decided to ignore my initial anxiety, crouched down, snapped a few frames, and turned the camera around to show h<img class="size-medium wp-image-1448 alignleft" title="09-11-14HFCanniversary063" src="/images//2009/11/09-11-14HFCanniversary063-199x300.jpg" alt="09-11-14HFCanniversary063" width="199" height="300" />er.  A suppressed smile crossed her face.  I looked at her eagerly hoping for a more telling expression of her feelings about the photo.  Getting only bashfulness, I offered mine: “Konjo.” (“Beautiful” in Amharic.)  The girl’s suppressed smile broke into a grin from ear to ear.  She quickly looked at the picture one more time to confirm the assessment and, satisfied, turned back toward the festivities.  I reluctantly show you the picture here to help you envision our interaction, but the real value of the exchange for me was in using my camera satisfy her curiosity and break through her shyness.  Seems that she valued the exchange around the photo at least as much as the photo itself, too.</p>

<p>Those who own the cameras and the means of storing and viewing the images still have the most leverage over visual representation.  That said, digital technology might help push stopgaps for postcolonial anxiety (like sharing copies of the final production) toward sharing the means of production, prioritizing the interaction between people, and jointly assessing the results.</p>
