###Experience Designer & Media Strategist

I believe in storytelling, empathy, and adventure. They spark the creativity to make us better people and a better society. As an experience designer and media strategist, I will get you doing and discovering things you might not otherwise. I'm often at the helm of a fair bit of creative chaos, be it with a film collective of AIDS orphans in Ethiopia or a punk rock video game gallery in New York City. I accentuate potential for the sake of greater impact and stability. My creative roots lie in documentary photography, and my current work involves games and real world adventures. 

<h3 class="subheader">Currently</h3>

Through graduate work at the School of Visual Arts's <a href="http://designresearch.sva.edu/program/" target="_blank">Design Research Program</a>, I'm exploring the design components of [transformative social experiences](/2016/04/sex-death-survival/).

I advise documentary and educational organizations like:

* <a href="http://magnumfoundation.org/photoex/" target="_blank">Photography, Expanded</a>, an initiative of the Magnum Foundation inspiring documentary photographers to extend their storytelling practice beyond the still image
* <a href="http://theheartradio.org/" target="_blank">The Heart Radio</a>, a podcast about love and intimacy on the Radiotopia network
* <a title="School For Poetic Computation" href="http://sfpc.io/" target="_blank">The School for Poetic Computation</a>, an artist-run school about the intersection of code, design, hardware, and theory

I also teach workshops on media, design, and exploration and give talks at venues like the Tribeca Film Festival and Businessweek's Design Conference. 

<h3 class="subheader">Formerly</h3>

I've co­founded two design outfits: [Sextantworks](http://sextantworks.com/), which orchestrated adventures in places you aren’t supposed to be, and [Antidote Games](http://playistheantidote.com/), which creates playful experiences for understanding complex realities. 

[Sextantworks](http://sextantworks.com/) functioned like a mix between a design studio and a Burning Man camp, creating dozens of site-specific adventures in New York City and abroad over the course of three and a half years. I organized the inspired exploits of intrepid underground creatives into a design methodology that drilled into the historical nature of unloved and overlooked places. We transformed people's sense of risk and possibility in the built environment. Our most famous project was a speakeasy in a dry water tower in Chelsea, Manhattan. We garnered a fair bit of attention in the press, attracting high-end, private commissions, among other client work.  

[Antidote Games](http://playistheantidote.com/) caters to humanitarian organizations and NGOs like the International Federation of the Red Cross, the African Climate Change Resilience Network, and the Innocence Project, making games that convey unfamiliar realities so players can understand why people make the decisions that they do. I worked with Antidote for the first two years of its existence, leading client relations and establishing the design workflow.  

Before founding the above-mentioned design entities, I traveled compulsively doing documentary projects and collaborative media production in Guatemala, India, and Brazil, and pursued a Fulbright-funded project in Ethiopia. 

As for schooling, I have an MA in Design Research from the School of Visual Arts, a BFA in Design & Technology from Parsons and a BA in History from The New School University.

Of all my accomplishments, few will top being voted &#8220;Most Likely to Discover Time Travel&#8221; by my junior high classmates.
