###Experience Designer & Media Strategist

I believe in storytelling, empathy, and adventure. They spark the creativity to make us better people and a better society. As an experience designer and media strategist, I will get you doing and discovering things you might not otherwise. I'm often at the helm of a fair bit of creative chaos, be it with a film collective of AIDS orphans in Ethiopia or a punk rock video game gallery in New York City. I bring on order for the sake of greater stability and impact. My creative roots lie in documentary photography, and my current work involves games and real world adventures.

Through graduate work at the School of Visual Arts's <a href="http://designresearch.sva.edu/program/" target="_blank">Design Research Program</a>, I'm exploring the design components of [transformative social experiences](/2016/04/sex-death-survival/).

I co-founded [Sextantworks](http://sextantworks.com/) (formerly Wanderlust Projects). We practice experiential gift design and transgressive placemaking through generosity, location, and intimacy. Sextantworks has been profiled in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/they-say-art-is-dead-in-new-york-theyre-wrong.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3031330/innovation-agents/this-companys-business-plan-includes-trespassing" target="_blank">Fast Company</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/event/music/320741516/on-a-magical-mystery-tour-with-hassan-hakmoun" target="_blank">NPR</a>, and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-design/a/ida-benedetto/" target="_blank">Businessweek</a>. I consulted on the experience design and gifting system for the <a href="http://nightheronspeakeasy.com/" target="_blank">Night Heron Speakeasy</a>, which has been lauded in <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/05/water-tower-flair/5639/" target="_blank">the Atlantic</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/05/27/130527ta_talk_freudenberger?mbid=social_tablet_e&pink=twLeIk" target="_blank">the New Yorker</a>.


I am an advisor to <a href="http://magnumfoundation.org/photoex/" target="_blank">Photography, Expanded</a>, an initiative of the Magnum Foundation to inspire documentary photographers to extend their storytelling practice beyond the still image, and <a href="http://theheartradio.org/" target="_blank">The Heart Radio</a>, a podcast about love and intimacy on the Radiotopia network. I am on the steering committee of the <a title="School For Poetic Computation" href="http://sfpc.io/" target="_blank">School for Poetic Computation</a>.

<h3 class="subheader">Formerly</h3>

I co-founded the design consultancy <a href="http://playistheantidote.com/" target="_blank">Antidote Games</a>. Antidote creates playful experiences for understanding complex realities. During my two years there, I spearheaded projects with the International Federation of the Red Cross, Columbia Teachers College, the African Climate Change Resilience Network, and the Innocence Project.

Before founding the above-mentioned design entities, I traveled compulsively doing documentary projects and collaborative media production in Guatemala, India, and Brazil, and pursued a Fulbright-funded project in Ethiopia. 

As for schooling, I have a BFA in Design & Technology from Parsons and a BA in History from The New School University.

Of all my accomplishments, few will top being voted &#8220;Most Likely to Discover Time Travel&#8221; by my junior high classmates.
