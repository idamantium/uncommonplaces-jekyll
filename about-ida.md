###Experience Designer & Media Strategist

I believe in storytelling, empathy, and adventure. They spark the creativity to make us better people and a better society. As a Media Strategist and Experience Designer, I will get you doing and discovering things you might not do otherwise. My creative roots lie in documentary photography, and my current work involves games and interactive experiences.

<h3 class="subheader">Currently</h3>

I am co-founder of [Sextantworks](http://sextant.works/) (formerly Wanderlust Projects). We make experiences in places you aren&#8217;t supposed to be, with a focus on the transformative power of intimacy, transgression, location, and generosity. Sextantworks has been profiled in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/they-say-art-is-dead-in-new-york-theyre-wrong.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3031330/innovation-agents/this-companys-business-plan-includes-trespassing" target="_blank">Fast Company</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/event/music/320741516/on-a-magical-mystery-tour-with-hassan-hakmoun" target="_blank">NPR</a>, and <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/15/a-most-illegal-adventure-with-new-york-city-s-wildest-underground-event-planners.html" target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a>. I consulted on the experience design and gifting system for <a href="http://nightheronspeakeasy.com/" target="_blank">the Night Heron Speakeasy</a>, which has been lauded in <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/05/water-tower-flair/5639/" target="_blank">the Atlantic</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/05/27/130527ta_talk_freudenberger?mbid=social_tablet_e&pink=twLeIk" target="_blank">the New Yorker</a>.

I am an advisor to <a href="http://magnumfoundation.org/photoex/" target="_blank">Photography, Expanded</a>, an initiative of the Magnum Foundation to inspire documentary photographers to extend their storytelling practice beyond the still image. I also co-organize <a title="Yellow Thread Society" href="http://yellowthreadsociety.org/" target="_blank">the Yellow Thread Society</a>, New York&#8217;s first (soon to be) regular get-together featuring women in games. I teach at the <a title="School For Poetic Computation" href="http://sfpc.io/" target="_blank">School for Poetic Computation</a>.

<h3 class="subheader">Formerly</h3>

For 2 years, I ran the design consultancy <a href="http://playistheantidote.com/" target="_blank">Antidote Games</a>. Antidote creates playful experiences for understanding complex realities. I spearheaded projects with the International Federation of the Red Cross, Columbia Teachers College, the African Climate Change Resilience Network, and the Innocence Project.

I have worked in Guatemala, India, and Brazil, on documentary projects and collaborative media production, which included a Fulbright-funded project in Ethiopia. 

I have a degree in Design & Technology from Parsons and a degree in History from The New School University.

Of all my accomplishments, few will top being voted &#8220;Most Likely to Discover Time Travel&#8221; by my junior high classmates.

<h4 class="subheader">Dyslexia Disclaimer</h4>

Think dyslexia is a disability? Dyslexics are visual-spacial thinkers. We understand things in context as part of systems that we can model in our minds. If you work with me on a complex system, like a game, event or website, you'll see what an asset a dyslexic can be.

I do my best to catch misspellings and typos. Unsolicited copyediting is the fastest way to my heart.
