This post links to most of the work I did over the past year as a Fulbrighter in Ethiopia (October 2009 &#8211; August 2010). While it will take some time to fully digest my experiences there, summarizing my work in one place serves to bookend that adventure.  The past month and a half back home in NYC has been an energetic leap toward new projects as I reconnect with friends and look for paid work.  Before I jump headlong into independent games and digital media strategy and art happenings, let me take stock of what I worked on over the past year.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sudden Flowers Productions</span>

My primary project in Addis Ababa entailed working with [Sudden Flowers Productions][1], a youth film collective of AIDS orphans. I went to Ethiopia with the intention of studying the collective, focusing specifically on the [impact that their creative work had on their sense of self and role in their community][2].  Sudden Flowers was much more interested in having me teach though, so I taught twice weekly lessons in [digital design and interactive media][3].  My favorite moment was when, upon explaining [a game][4] that initially baffled the group, [Adane][5] chimed in with this realization that &#8220;you make the story happen by playing it.&#8221; It was so gratifying to help them wrap their heads around new cultural forms and create some themselves.  Together we produced a website about their contributions to the 9th anniversary of the orphanage many of them call home.  The project is call *[A Talent No One Knew We Had][6]*.  After all the gaming and coding, Sudden Flowers wanted to get back to filmmaking for a little.  I helped them [fundraise for their new film on Kickstarter][7].  Contributors were treated to weekly letter from the collective on the progress of the film and a copy of the finished work.

I did get to do some research in the end. I conducted in depth interviews with the collective members and gathered as much material as I could about the context they were working in.  I&#8217;ve never amassed so much primary material on a research project, and I&#8217;m not sure where to start with it&#8230;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teaching</span>

*The Democracy Video Challenge*  
My first opportunity to teach beyond Sudden Flowers came with the [Democracy Video Challenge][8].  The first day I set foot in the U.S. Embassy in Addis, someone put me up to doing a workshop on the competition to encourage local filmmakers to submit entries. [The results were spectacular][9], which is a real testament to the enthusiasm and potential bursting from Ethiopia&#8217;s growing film scene.  On my last flight out of Addis, I ran into Ethiopian Yared Shumete, the competition&#8217;s finalist for Africa, on his way to meet diplomats and filmmakers in the U.S. as part of his prize.

*Addis Ababa University*  
The Journalism and Communications program at Addis Ababa University was eager to have me teach as well.  It was thorny navigating the climate of intense censorship and repression as national elections approached.  While the University is technically autonomous, the entire first year class of graduate Journalism and Communications students were hand picked by the government with the intention that they would go on to teach at regional universities currently being opened across Ethiopia.  I taught [photojournalism workshops][10] to supplement their media production classes.  It was clear that the students would benefit from any opportunity to work on their visual literacy skills, so I gave [a series of lectures][11] on the topic at the University&#8217;s English Language Improvement Center.

*Internews*  
[Internews][12] gave me a chance to teach working photojournalists.  The workshop on [photojournalism and AIDS][13] went over issues of ethics and consent and included field trips to several organizations working on AIDS and related issues. The workshop was so successful that the students work was gathered into an exhibition and catalog called [*A Light In A Shadow*][14].

*The Climate Center of the Red Cross/Red Crescent*  
Shortly after I finished the Fulbright, the [Climate Center of the International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies][15] sent me back to Ethiopia to teach [Participatory Video][16].  The Ethiopian Red Cross had been working in Ebinat outside of Bahir Dar for over a year helping the community confront the impact of climate change on their livelihoods and safety.  I taught a dozen community members [to make short videos][17] on the impact those projects were having.  The videos will be used to motivate other communities to adopt the programs as well.  The farmers of Ebinat were eager to serve as role models for others and thoroughly enjoyed making the videos about their community.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Photo Essays</span>

And when things were slow, I worked on photo essays.  [Shegar FM is Ethiopia&#8217;s first independent radio station][18].  [T&H Designs is a jewelry design and training business][19] by two young talented designers who are identical twins.  [One Laptop Per Child is distributing laptops][20] to a few grade schools in Ethiopia. I vented my frustrations with the sexism I encountered in Addis by [photographing discarded used condoms][21].
